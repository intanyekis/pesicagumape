Jonah Hill is a comedic film actor and producer who starred in films such as Knocked Up, <a href=#>Superbad</a>, 21 and 22 Jump Street, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, How To Train Your Dragon and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was a plus-size actor since he'd been in Hollywood, but recently, Jonah Hill has put his health first and dramatically changed his life. He is now what one would call "zen." Hill has disappeared for a while, like he does sometimes, and comes back better than ever.</p><p>But don't worry, <a href=#>he isn't quitting acting. </a>Hill is just taking some time to better himself, so he can be the best person and actor he can be.</p><p>From his weight to his style to <a href=#>how he lives his day to day life</a>, here's how Jonah Hill dramatically changed his life.</p><h2 id=reflecting-on-his-twenties><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Reflecting On His Twenties</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He had a personal evolution between his twenties and thirties. His overnight success led him to "have too much power and not enough life skills." His fame happened overnight, and he never got a chance to finish college, like his friends, and live a normal life. "I didn’t realize until I turned 30 that what those four years gave all my friends was this wobbling period of how to be a person. I was really advanced professionally but really behind personally. All my 20s, I wasn’t really looking inward. I was just running toward success. Or trying to find success," he said in a recent interview with GQ.</p><p>When he was in his 20s, he would let people be brutal to him and would even treat himself badly because he wasn't sure of his own value. “I sucked at skateboarding. But I would throw myself down 10 stairs to make my friends laugh, knowing I couldn’t ever do any trick that would be good,” he explained. “Or in comedy, I would be brutal to myself, or allow brutality to me, because I felt like that was my seat at the table."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonah-hill-on-working-out-every-day><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jonah Hill On Working Out Every Day</span></h2><p>Since 2017, Jonah Hill has been working on getting fit and results are definitely showing. He believed he could get better roles if he slimmed down and debuted his new look after his role in Moneyball. Every morning he has a workout routine, and sometimes he even stops in the morning for a smoothie before hitting the gym.</p><p>The actor found a nutritionist and personal trainer to help him in his weight-loss journey. The nutritionist had him eating fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains and lean protein. He also incorporates a lot of sushi into his diet and eliminated alcohol. Hill also exercises regularly. He started with jogging, sit-ups and push-ups and worked his way up to more strenuous workouts. He saw results quickly and got a huge boost of self-confidence as a result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Little Revealing Facts Jonah Hill Wants To Keep On The DL</a></span></p><h2 id=his-style-and-look><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Style And Look</span></h2><p>Many people would describe his new style as Zen.

"I said, 'What's the deal, man? You're the happiest guy I've ever seen in my life. Why are you so f------ happy? And he's like, 'I don't look around at what anybody else is doing. I just live my life, and I don't look at what other people are doing.'"
