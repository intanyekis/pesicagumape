During the COVID-19 pandemic, the two-time Oscar winner <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilary Swank has moved to Colorado</a>; though the move was not intended, she has been in Colorado since last year and has not moved back since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The property is a walled and gated compound that can assure the new owner's privacy and safety. It features six bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms and has views of the stunning hillside ocean for every room. Swank bought the 6700 square foot hacienda in 2007 for $5.8 Million, and she's looking at a profit of almost $5 million if she sells the property. According to Swank's interview on The Wall Street Journal, the 1920's property has good bones. The property's design was detailed like the exceptional tile work, the hand-painted ceilings, and some hidden compartments, which she thinks is where the previous owners hid their alcohol stash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Restaurants in Los Angeles</a></span></p><p>Though the mansion is good as it is, Swank <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has made some renovations</a> and upgrades to the place during her stay there. One of those upgrades is the 16 seat movie theater with a lounge and concession stand. The theater is also filled with snacks like candies, beers, and a classical popcorn maker. Swank also built an outdoor kitchen on the multi-story property and had an ocean view fire pit done on the place. Another upgrade made on the property is the swimming pool and hot tub built on the lower terrace just below the house with an open-air cabana diner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The property is listed under <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach Goldsmith at Hilton & Hyland</a>. Swank once tried to sell the property between 2012 and 2013. When she lived in France and put the house up for grabs for $9.45 Million; however, the sale did not push through. Another property Swank owned aside from her Los Angeles Mansion and Colorado property is the two-bedroom condo in West Village, New York, for $3.65 million in the year 2009.</p><p>The actress who's currently <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starring on the Netflix series</a> Away&nbsp;has stated that she and her husband, Philip Schneider, decided that moving to Colorado would be best, and they are planning to plant their roots in Colorado.
