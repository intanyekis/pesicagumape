That said, this movie won't see Hart playing the role someone like Robert Downey Jr. took when he was cast as Iron Man or Chris Pratt as Starlord. No, Hart's role is quite different from most superhero action films fans line up around the block to see.</p><p>Hart is getting his&nbsp;own superpowered film, entitled Night Wolf. The film is being described as a&nbsp;Meet The Parents-type&nbsp;movie where Hart plays a regular Joe who meets his fiancée’s parents for the first time, only to find out that her father has a unique gift.</p><p>Hart won't only star in the film but his production company, HartBeat Productions will be helping produce the project. There are no other details for the film at this time, including who else might cast in the movie or when it will be released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-this-means>What This Means</h2><p>Speculation is that Hart will play the role of the fiancée in Night Wolf, and take on the comedic lead as the potential son-in-law left to figure out how to deal with becoming part of a family that has a superhero dad. The other major casting decision will be who plays the father-in-law, the character of Night Wolf.</p><p>As for other Hart projects, you can currently hear him in “The Secret Life of Pets 2” and he will star in “Jumanji: The Next Level” in December alongside good friend Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. He is currently filming “Fatherhood,” which is set for a 2020 release.</p><p><strong>Next:&nbsp;<a title="The Lion King Passes Frozen As The Highest-Grossing Animated Film Ever" href=#>The Lion King Passes Frozen As The Highest-Grossing Animated Film Ever</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8qeraKmXZ2us8CMrKypnaKdsrO7jKamr6GVYruqs8etZLCnnJt8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
