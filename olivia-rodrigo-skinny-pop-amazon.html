It is just my favorite snack. There is just one open bag of Skinny Pop on my piano at all times, on my desk at all times, and then in the kitchen at all times. Open, just ready for me to consume. I truly lots of days will eat, like, this entire thing. So good! I will bring this into the movie theater because it’s so much better than the movie theater popcorn to me. Let’s see what other flavors they have… kettle corn, popcorn mini cakes. Wow. There’s a whole Skinny Pop cinematic universe I need to try.”</p><p>This guilt-free and gluten-free snack is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">no. 1 bestselling popcorn on Amazon</a>!
