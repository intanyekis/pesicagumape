We'll discuss that, along with <a href=#>Brandi Passante's recent revealing interview</a>, as she discussed what the show doesn't decide to air.

Defendants have even gone so far as to stage entire storage units, and will enlist the cooperation of the owners of the storage facilities to stage entire units."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Things About Storage Wars We Don't Understand</a></span></p><p>Alongside Business Insider, Hester would also claim that bids would be made when auctions weren't even running just for show purposes, ''While on location filming an auction, Defendants (A&E) also film footage of the cast members and the public bidding when no actual auction is taking place in order to make it appear that any of the cast members are bidding at any given auction, whether or not he or she is actually bidding on the unit."</p><p>We're not entirely sure whether or not that was the truth. What we do know, is that Brandi revealed alongside Distractify that not all units are shown on the air.</p><h2 id=the-network-omits-certain-units>The Network Omits Certain Units</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside Distractify, Brandi Passante discussed some elements of the show that are lesser-known. Unlike Dave's past comments, she revealed that the show is in fact real and that tampering with units is against the law.</p><p>However, she did admit that certain elements of the show are not shown. Sure, we see the best of the best units, however during the course of the day, <a href=#>several units are purchased and not all of them make it onto the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>''You're going to get good ones and bad ones, and I don't think the show really highlights the bad ones as much ... but it definitely happens," Brandi said. "From the very beginning, I think when people saw the show, they just assumed that this was some kind of get-rich-quick, modern-day treasure hunt and in every unit, you're going to find something great â€” but that's just not how it goes. You just have to try your best to make a guesstimate as to what's going to be in there."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Things The Storage Wars Cast Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><p>Brandi revealed that signs of a good unit are those that are well put together. If the unit seems to be out of place and just thrown everywhere, chances are, the owner didn't care for whatever is in there and therefore, the buyers shouldn't care either.</p><h2 id=the-show-continues-on>The Show Continues On</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality show started way back in 2010 and over a decade later, it remains on the air, currently in its 13th season.
