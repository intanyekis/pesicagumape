Country star <strong>Rodney Atkins</strong> and his wife, <strong>Rose Falcon</strong>, have welcomed a new addition to their family — a baby boy.</p><p>The singer, 48, shared the happy news in a photo posted on Instagram on Friday, December 15. “Ryder Falcon Atkins, our most precious Christmas present is here,” he captioned the adorable snap, which showed the doting mom holding the newborn as he looked on in awe.</p><p>Shortly after, the dad of two couldn’t contain his excitement, he changed the headline on his profile to “Ry has arrived,” and added another picture that revealed the baby’s chubby cheeks. “One more Ryder pic,” he wrote.</p><p>The duo announced the gender in a video they shared with Entertainment Tonight in September where they also revealed the name. “I told her that I always liked the name Ry and she immediately said, ‘How about Ryder and you can call him Ry for short?'” Atkins said at the time. “Before the name came along, we went through a million, but the second she said Ryder Falcon and got the thumbs up from Eli, Ry’s big brother, we agreed that was it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Atkins hasn’t been shy to show photos of Rose throughout the past few months and has captured milestone memories of the pregnancy. After weeks of anticipation, the couple snapped a selfie on Tuesday, December 12, as they attended their last checkup before the arrival of their son.</p><p>Atkins and Falcon tied the knot in 2013. He was previously married to ex-wife <strong>Tammy Jo</strong> for 13 years before filing for divorce in 2011. The two share a teenage son, Elijah, together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp5Sjsrp5wK2ioqajYr%2Bwv8RmnZqkk6S7bsPEpZqopZVirm6uwJuwZpqfrnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
