We all want to feel confident in the appearance of our booty, even if we’re not going around screaming it. Unfortunately, it’s prone to cellulite and dimples, stretch marks and even bumps. It’s not always such a huge deal, but when beach and pool weather starts to roll around, we really wish everything would just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">smooth out</a>&nbsp;already!</p><p>You may have tried exfoliating your butt in the past using your body scrub, but chances are it wasn’t necessarily fit to target all of your insecurities. That’s why we want to introduce everyone to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Becky Booty Scrub</a>. It’s affordable, it’s on Prime and it’s ready to help you achieve that juicy peach perfection!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Becky Booty Scrub</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!

In just a few uses, you could be seeing a major difference in the skin on your butt, legs and beyond. It contains provitamin B5 to help generate new skin cells, which may break down and reduce the appearance of cellulite, while ingredients like organic aloe vera leaf juice may soften the visibility of stretch marks. But it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>What makes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this scrub</a> a scrub is the walnut shell powder, a powerful exfoliant that’s super finely ground to feel nice on the skin. It may help unclog pores to reduce acne and blackheads. It could also be a huge help on your bikini line to help prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Becky Booty Scrub</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!

We also want to note that this scrub could be a big help if you’re dealing with conditions like keratosis pilaris. Feel free to use it on your arms too if they have KP!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This scrub</a> is even fun to use, expanding and forming a creamy lather when used on wet skin in the shower. Just rinse when you’re all scrubbed out, and, as always, remember some body lotion when you’re all dried off too. It’s recommended that you use this booty scrub at least three times a week, but listen to your skin for best results!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Becky Booty Scrub</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!
