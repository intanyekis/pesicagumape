Unfazed and with a sparkle in her eye, she swiftly retorted, “I say it wrong? Oh, because you speak better English than me? Ah,” leaving Motos, and probably the entire studio, in stitches.</p><p>Seizing the moment, Vergara transformed the linguistic sparring into a comedic spectacle. Undeterred, she went on to school Mottos in the art of Emmy and Golden Globe nominations.</p><p>“How many Emmy nominations do you have in the United States? How many times did they nominate you at the Golden Globes?” she shot back, turning the tables and making it clear that in the game of accolades, she reigns supreme.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sofia-Vergara-1024x576.jpg><p>This linguistic banter isn’t unfamiliar territory for Vergara. In a previous skirmish with <a href=# data-type=post data-id=13212>Ellen DeGeneres</a>, the talk show host playfully poked fun at Vergara’s English proficiency while discussing a script.</p><p>However, true to her fiery spirit, Vergara defended DeGeneres and clarified that the banter was all in good fun.</p><p>Taking to social media, she shared her perspective on the matter, stating, “Two comedians having fun with each other to entertain. I was never a victim, guys, I was always in on the joke.”</p><p>What sets Vergara apart is not just her linguistic wit but her ability to navigate such moments with charm and humor.</p><p>As a non-native English speaker who has conquered Hollywood, she stands as a testament to the fact that linguistic diversity is not a hurdle but a superpower.</p><p>From Barranquilla to Hollywood, she has showcased her talent, adaptability, and unrivaled ability to drop the mic in any language.</p><p>Beyond her linguistic prowess, Vergara is a quadruple threat, with four Golden Globe nominations and an Emmy nod to her name.</p><p>Her portrayal of Gloria Pritchett, the vivacious and hilarious character in Modern Family, not only etched her name in television history but also earned her legions of fans worldwide.</p><p>In her personal life, Vergara recently made headlines with the announcement of her separation from actor Joe Manganiello, her husband of seven years.</p><p>The joint statement released by the former couple emphasized their enduring love and mutual respect while politely asking for privacy during this transitional phase.</p><p>Even in the face of personal changes, Vergara manages to keep her cool, proving that she’s not just a linguistic maestro but an embodiment of grace under pressure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd70qidopldq7Kzs8CrmGarmKrBtHnDqK6nZZyWu6jBwKCcZpuinsGqr9JmrqKsmGKubrPOpZuepl2cubCuwKWjsmWRpb2zu9Wem2almZh6pb7OqWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
