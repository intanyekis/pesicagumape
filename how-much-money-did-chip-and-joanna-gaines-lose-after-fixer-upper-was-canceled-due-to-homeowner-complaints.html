But when Fixer Upper ended, it seems like Joanna and Chip walked away from what must have been an incredible salary. How did ending Fixer Upper affect Chip and Joanna Gaines's net worth?</p><h2 id=what-was-chip-and-joanna-gaines-39-s-fixer-upper-salary-and-what-money-could-they-have-made>What Was Chip And Joanna Gaines's Fixer Upper Salary And What Money Could They Have Made?</h2><p>Chip and Joanna Gaines have a great marriage and it shows in every episode of Fixer Upper. Their jokes and good moods seem genuine and they appear to love working together.</p><p>E! News shared that Joanna and Chip are thought to have earned $30,000 from every Fixer Upper episode. That would translate to more than $510,000 for each season. The clients also pay the Gaines for the renovations and designs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Joanna and Chip share a $50 million net worth</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Fixer Upper definitely helped them add to their net worth over the years. It's definitely a risk to say no to a project that pays that much money. Of course, Chip and Joanna have continued to do very well in the years after Fixer Upper. But there's no doubt that this was absolutely a huge moneymaker for the couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chip-and-joanna-gaines.jpg><p>Since Fixer Upper aired for five seasons of 79 episodes from 2013 to 2018, Chip and Joanna were paid well. And it's easy to think that if they had continued with the series, they would have continued to earn high salaries. Their net worths would have likely grown even more.</p><p>If Chip and Joanna Gaines are thought to have earned half a million from every season, even just two more seasons could have meant a huge increase in their bank accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chip-and-joanna-gaines-on-fixer-upper.jpg><p>Even if the Gaines were still filming Fixer Upper, it seems that they could still have started other projects.

The couple told People that their children would inquire about when they were shooting episodes and they felt that it was time-consuming so it felt natural to say goodbye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Joanna and Chip wanted to be able to make money in other ways. A source told the publication, “Scripps talent contracts are very restrictive. The talent can’t do anything without their approval — any appearance, any publicity, any endorsement, any product — you have to ask them for permission. It is awful. And on top of that, Scripps takes a big percentage of everything you make — books, appearances, endorsements, products. If you make money, they take most of the money.”</p><p>The Page Six article says that the couple felt that with Discovery owning Scripps, they could find a good deal that they would be happier with.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Chip And Joanna Gaines Did Before HGTV And Fixer Upper</a></span></p><p>Page Six reported that HGTV's official statement was, “Of course, this inflammatory information is inaccurate.

These episodes aired in 2022 and the couple was likely paid well for them. It was fun for fans to see the familiar couple back in action.</p><p>According to Heavy.com, Chip purchased the castle in 2019, and while Joanna felt it was "daunting," they were both up for the challenge. As Joanna shared in an article in the Magnolia Journal, “As a designer, it stretched me in ways I couldn’t have imagined until we were in the thick of it. But I’m glad we trusted our instincts and swung back to the castle’s roots instead of trying to create something completely new.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMnJ%2BiqF2Wu6V5yaiYp6aRYrSitc2eqmakn6iybq3FrZyrZZaexaa%2BjK6nqZ2iYsSiv4ycmKeblaGypXnDrpxmrJ9itbC5xKiup52iYrCwuc%2BlmKKmpKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
