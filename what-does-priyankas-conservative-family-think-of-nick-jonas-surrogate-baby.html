On January 21, they also announced the birth of their first baby, their eldest daughter Malti Marie Chopra Jonas. <a href=#>Nick and Priyanka later told the gender following the welcome of their surrogate child</a>, followed by an Instagram post by Priyanka expressing how grateful she was to celebrate her first-ever Mother's Day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Nick Jonas Meet His Wife, Priyanka Chopra?</a></span></p><p>Many of their fans and celebrity friends, including Kerry Washington, Sofia Carson, and Gal Gadot, said their congratulations and happy wishes for the new many by commenting on Priyanka's post. It wasn't a surprise when the news reached CBS News' headline-only two days after the power couple's big announcement.</p><h2 id=is-nick-jonas-and-priyanka-39-s-baby-premature><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Is Nick Jonas And Priyanka's Baby Premature?</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priyanka and Nick Jonas' surrogate baby had to stay in the NICU</a> or Newborn Intensive Care Unit for more than three months, and this is according to Priyanka's April 2022 Instagram post. According to Priyanka, baby Malti was born premature, meaning the surrogate mother gave birth twelve weeks earlier than her due date. It was emotionally challenging for the new parents as babies in the NICU are at high health risk because their organs are not yet fully developed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Located in a Southern California hospital, Priyanka and Nick had to closely monitor the progress of their baby's development with the help of the NICU staff. The doctors finally gave their daughter a signal to go home in April after accumulating 100 days of hospital stay.</p><h2 id=priyanka-chopra-has-always-wanted-babies><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Priyanka Chopra Has Always Wanted Babies</span></h2><p>Priyanka Chopra, now aged 39 years old, has been open about wanting babies with her husband Nick Jonas, 29 years old. In an interview with The Sunday Times, she even says a cricket team composed of eleven players would make her happy. "I do want children, as many as I can have," the Bollywood actress adds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Priyanka Chopra’s Absence From ‘Matrix 4’ Promos An Example Of A Big Hollywood Problem?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Nick Jonas also shows support for her wife, saying, "We'd be blessed with any child, son or daughter or anything," in an interview with Extra. The couple has been openly telling the public about their long-term goals for the family, adding up to the media's pressure for Priyanka to get pregnant.</p><h2 id=why-did-nick-jonas-and-priyanka-choose-surrogacy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Did Nick Jonas And Priyanka Choose Surrogacy?</span></h2><p>Rumors about Nick Jonas and Priyanka's break-up sparked when <a href=#>Priyanka removed 'Jonas' from her Instagram profile.</a> Some fans speculated that it might be because their want for a baby has not been parallel with their lifestyle. With Priyanka just finishing The Matrix Resurrections, a 2021 film, she played the role of Sati alongside co-stars Keanu Reeves and Jessica Henwick, and Nick Jonas just completing his latest season on The Voice; the two have been busy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Priyanka's age has also been a reason they chose surrogacy because pregnancy becomes more complicated at the age of 39 and has more health risks. They both recognize the difficulty in their schedule and Priyanka's age, convincing them that surrogate pregnancy is the best method for child conception for them.</p><h2 id=priyanka-chopra-jonas-39-conservative-punjabi-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Priyanka Chopra Jonas' Conservative Punjabi Family</span></h2><p>As what Priyanka calls a middle-class family, her India-based family is considered by many to be well-off because of her mother, Madhu Chopra, and father, Ashok Chopra, who are both doctors. When Priyanka was only beginning her career in pageantry and film, her family was firm in resisting her decision. However, it did not take long for her family to see their daughter turn into one of the most sought-after Bollywood actresses. <a href=#>Priyanka's sister Parineeti Chopra is also following her steps as a Bollywood actress.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Priyanka Chopra Trolls Husband Nick Jonas's Acting Skills During The ‘Jonas Brothers Family Roast’</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priyanka has been trying to follow her family's traditional values</a>, like how she and Nick had a Hindu wedding. Although her parents would have wanted to live a low-profile lifestyle for her, pursuing a career less public than a celebrity, they now accept Priyanka's fame. In some cases, they have even agreed to answer interviews about her and Nick in the past.</p><h2 id=priyanka-39-s-family-is-happy-for-nick-jonas-and-her-surrogate-baby><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Priyanka's Family Is Happy For Nick Jonas And Her Surrogate Baby</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meera, Priyanka's cousin, says she's happy about Priyanka's new life chapter</a>.
