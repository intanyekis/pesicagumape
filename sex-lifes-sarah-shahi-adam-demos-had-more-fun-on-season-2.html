The actors play Billie Connelly and Brad Simon, respectively on the Netflix series.</p><p>“They’re a delight,” Hudecki told Us of <a href=#>the real-life couple</a>. “We didn’t get to do very much with the two of them this season. So every time we did it was very easy.”</p><p>The Canadian-based fight director added: “They were like, ‘Yep, we know this, we know that we know this.’ We had a very nice shorthand.”</p><p>Shahi and Demos confirmed their romance on New Year’s Eve in 2020 after meeting on the set of the Netflix drama earlier that year. The relationship came a few months after <a href=#>Us exclusively confirmed</a> in June 2020 that <a href=#>the Texas native split from husband <strong>Steve Howey</strong></a> after 11 years of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sarah-Shahi-and-Adam-Demos-Were-%E2%80%98Free-to-Have-a-Lot-More-Fun-and-Play-on-%E2%80%98Sex-Life-Season-2-Says-Intimacy-Coordinator-2.jpg><p>The L Word alum, who shares <a href=#>son William, 13, and twins Violet and Knox, 8</a>, with the <a href=#>Shameless</a> alum, 45, <a href=#>finalized her divorce in January 2021</a>.</p><p>Later that month, Demos gushed over Shahi on her birthday. “Happy bday my baby, I f*#kin love you. You’re everything,” he wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><p>The Black Adam actress <a href=#>returned the favor on Demos’ special day</a> in May 2021. “I do know I found my forever. I do know I’ve never loved deeper, harder, more ferociously,” Shahi wrote via social media. “I do know I’m overly grateful for him. I do know I’ve loved him for a thousand lifetimes before and will love him for a thousand lifetimes more.”</p><p>The couple confirmed they are still going strong by <a href=#>packing on the PDA</a> at the February premiere of <a href=#>Sex/Life season 2</a> in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sex/Life season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqesF2htqex0maqmqqRnXq0tMChoGaZlJa6brDEpqasZZiWsW65zqucZp6lo3qwuoysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
