They had been rumored to be together for about two years, with Chyna originally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sharing a snapshot with him (and then quickly deleting it)</a> in Dec. 2020. Then, in 2021, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her mother,<strong> Tokyo Toni</strong></a>, confirmed they are indeed in a relationship. “She’s with Lil Twin. They’ve been together about two years or so now,” she told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Sun</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Twin Hector, however, seems to have confirmed their relationship back in Oct. 2021 with a photo of himself grabbing onto her bodacious bottom, which can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. So, who is the man who has the key to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of two</a>‘s heart? Read on to learn about rapper Twin Hector.</p><h2>1. Twin Hector Is A Rapper And Fashion Designer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Twin Hector is a rapper who featured Blac Chyna in his 2021 video, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Woman’s Worth”</a>.

He has 5,200 monthly listeners on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spotify</a> as of this writing and his top songs include “Assignment”, “All Into It”, and “Ok Look”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>His <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> also lists him as a fashion designer, and he has a section that sells his line, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SCHIZO</a>. His offerings include t-shirts, shorts, and tracksuits.

Blac Chyna And Twin Hector Were Rumored To Be Engaged</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2021, a celebrity hairstylist named <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jay&nbsp;</strong></a>claimed that Chyna had booked him for her “upcoming wedding”, as you can see by the below screenshot. While his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> shows that he has worked with the reality star, the wedding never seemed to happen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Plus, Chyna’s mom told The Sun that she was unaware of an engagement at the time. “Today was my first-time hearing about it. I’m shocked,” she said. She also confirmed that her daughter was not expecting a child. Chyna shares her daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dream</strong></a>, 6, with ex-fiancé <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rob Kardashian</strong></a>, and her 10-year-old son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>King Cairo</strong></a>, with rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tyga</strong></a>.</p><h2>3. Twin Hector Likes To Show Off His Money</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Money seems to be no problem for Twin Hector. As seen above, in 2022, he created a stick figure person with $50 bills and proudly posed on the ground next to it. Later in the year, he held a thick stack of $20 bills on his shoulder. The stack was so high that it reached above his head. He’s also posted with luxury cars several times and even gloated that he “Came home 2 Lamb Chop for Dinner..” in Aug. 2021 as he laid across a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>white Lamborghini</a>.</p><h2>4. Twin Hector Loves Playing Basketball</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>While fashion and music seem to be the passions that make him money, Twin Hector also has another passion: basketball. His <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> feed is scattered with footage of him <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>playing the spprt</a>. Plus, during the early morning hours of Jan. 30, 2023, he posted an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram Story</a> from Los Angeles and asked if anyone was around to shoot some hoops. Now that’s dedication!</p><h2>5. Tattoos Cover Twin Hector’s Torso</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Like several other famous musicians, such as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> or <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, Twin Hector’s torso and arms are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>covered by tattoos</a>, as seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. Some of his tattoos include “Madonna” on his right chest and “Twin” on his left chest.
