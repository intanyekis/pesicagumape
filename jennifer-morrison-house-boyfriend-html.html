It looks like the two might have bonded enough for Morrison to buy Fogelman’s expansive Toluca Lake estate.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Earlier this year, Fogelman and his wife Caitlin Thompson paid $17.5 million for their new home, which is the most anyone’s ever paid for a home in that area. After six months, the couple sold their other smaller Toluca Lakehouse near their new place.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>With a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth of</a>&nbsp;$8 million, the actress comfortably shelled&nbsp;out&nbsp;$4.2 million for the estimated 5,300-square-foot building, and should she choose to live in her new home; she will be neighbors with moguls such as oil heiress Nats Getty and her wife Gigi Gorgeous, Sia, Steve Carell, and <a href=# rel=follow>Diddy</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There aren’t many photos of Morrison’s new house as the deal was carried out exclusively, but records show the partially classic American-styled cottage was constructed in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Details of the House</h2><p>Like most modern homes in affluent neighborhoods, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Morrison’s new home</a> is equipped with a state-of-the-art security system and home automation.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>It also features a traditional Colonial hall plan and an attached two-car garage. Upon entering the main floor, one will be greeted by an expansive common room with custom built-ins and a fireplace. The room has massive glass walls that offer a relaxing view of the outdoor greenery. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The common room opens to a contemporary kitchen, which offers marble worktops, a multi-purpose island, and Wolf and SubZero appliances. The first floor also has a wine cellar, movie theater, and guest bedroom suite.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On the second floor, there are four bedrooms with attached bathrooms. The master bedroom is extra luxurious, with a dome vault and a marble fireplace. The bathroom has its own freestanding tub and his and her vanities.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, the walk-in closet has white open shelves and a neutral, natural wood floor, adding&nbsp;zen to the roomy closet.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for the backyard, it might not be the biggest one out there, but it certainly comes with a sparkling pool and spa, built-in BBQ, dining loggia, and privacy hedges.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Morrison’s Relationship</h2><p>This is not the only property that The&nbsp;Once Upon A Time&nbsp;actress owns.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>She and her boyfriend</a>,&nbsp;Passions&nbsp;actor Gerardo Celasco, own a one-bedroom apartment in a neoclassical Beaux-Arts building along New York City’s Park Avenue.

Before her relationship with the actor, Morrison was&nbsp;with her&nbsp;Once Upon A Time&nbsp;co-star <a href=# rel=follow>Sebastian Stan</a>, who played the Mad Hatter, for a year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She was even&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;to fellow&nbsp;House M.D. star Jesse Spencer. The pair played Allison Cameron and Robert Chase, who were lovers on Fox’s medical series.</p><p>In 2006, Spencer proposed to Morrison at the Eiffel Tower. They were planning to become husband and wife&nbsp;a year later, but to everyone’s surprise, they called off their engagement.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But that is all in the past.
