Like <a href=#>he was undressing me with his eyes</a>,” Simpson, 42, wrote in her Amazon<a href=#> essay</a>, which was published on Wednesday, February 1, of the twosome’s first meeting at the 2001 <a href=#>Video Music Awards</a>.</p><p class=p2>The pair quickly hit it off as the “Take My Breath Away” singer <a href=#>navigated one of her breakups</a> from ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Nick Lachey</strong></a>. (Simpson and Lachey, 49, were <a href=#>married between 2002 and 2006</a> after an on-and-off romance.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jessica-Simpson-Reveals-Secret-Affair-Never-Ever-in-a-Million-Years-Going-to-Be-the-Other-Woman-1.jpg><p class=p2>The Texas native — who did not further identify her mystery man — initially “wasn’t ready” to take things further <a href=#>following the VMAs afterparty</a>, but later <a href=#>ran into him again at the gym</a> in Los Angeles. There, she invited him to <a href=#>star in one of her upcoming music videos</a>.</p><p class=p1>“‘You could be my lead guy,’ I offered to this man who made millions and millions per film,” she claimed in Wednesday’s essay.</p><p class=p1>The twosome’s connection did not go any further as Simpson reconciled with Lachey in&nbsp;September 2001, with the&nbsp;<i>Employee of the Month&nbsp;</i>star declining to call the actor back. However, <a href=#>once Simpson and Lachey divorced</a>, she reconnected with her mystery man, who allegedly first kissed her at the Beverly Hills Hilton.</p><p class=p1>“I felt this warm rush all the way down my body to the tips of my toes in my wedges,” the&nbsp;<i>Open Book&nbsp;</i>author wrote.</p><p class=p1>Despite <a href=#>an intense first kiss</a>, Simpson was heartbroken when saw red carpet pics of her supposed beau and his then-girlfriend.</p><p class=p1>“I was <a href=#>never ever in a million years going to be</a> the other woman,” she claimed, asserting that the movie star told her their relationship was “completely over” and he was only interested in pursuing Simpson.</p><p class=p1>The twosome went on to embark on a whirlwind romance, attending events at nightclubs together and<a href=#> bonding over the birth of Simpson’s goddaughter</a>. The fashion designer even visited her man on a movie set, however, that trip made her feel like she was only there to “have sex” with her famous fling.</p><p class=p1>“Yes, there was something sexy and enticing about all this, but there was also something demeaning about it. I felt like a call girl,” Simpson recalled in the passage, noting it felt like he was trying to “hide” her from his “chick.” She continued: “I didn’t care if <a href=#>he was my teenage fantasy come to life</a>, this was not a choice that same girl, my younger self, would be proud of.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jessica-Simpson-Reveals-Secret-Affair-Never-Ever-in-a-Million-Years-Going-to-Be-the-Other-Woman-2.jpg><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Newlyweds</a>&nbsp;</i>alum left his room the next day and broke off their romance.
