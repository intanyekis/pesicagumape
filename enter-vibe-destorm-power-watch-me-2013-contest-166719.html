If you’re not familiar with DeStorm, he basically turned his life around from a tiny-ass empty apartment to a big house and broads on each arm thanks to the Internets, posting viral videos that have helped him amass some 1.5 million subscribers on his YouTube page.</p><p>The online sensation is back with his “Watch Me” contest. Power wants fans to help him complete his latest track “<a href=# id=auto-tag_turn-down-for-what_3 data-tag=turn-down-for-what>Turn Down For What?</a>” by creating a verse he’s left blank. The wannabe Jay-Z who turns up with the best 16 bars wins not only the collabo with DeStorm but also some mentions on VIBE and a money sandwich for their wallet.</p><p>DeStorm will choose the top 10-15 finalists who will then be at the mercy of his popping online fanbase — 235,000+ Facebook fans and all those YouTube heads we already told you about — for the final count and win. Official rules below. Turn up and good luck.</p><p><strong>Watch Me 2013 Official Rules:</strong><br>1.
