Caroline also showed footage of her luggage lying wide open, having been picked through by the intruders. She also posted a photo of what appeared to be a broken lock at an entry point to her vacation pad. “stay safe … i have hired security now,” she noted.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Sergio, 27, added a message to his own social media following the terrifying incident. “it was so scary that I can’t express it,” he wrote on his Instagram Story.&nbsp; “This is the f–king problem with the society and people.. and why the world is becoming this way,” he continued, adding that he now misses the security of Dubai.

They’ve flooded their Instagram Stories with fun snapshots and videos of themselves lounging on the beach and at cozy eateries. One video showed an intimate look at Carolina and Sergio’s love, as Caroline rested directly on top of her husband, who was lying on a lounge chair. “This is what happens when you have a favorite human,” Sergio said in the video. Caroline cheerfully added, “That’s me.” Sergio then gave his wife several kisses on her shoulder before the footage ended.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-7></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by carolinestanbury (@carolinestanbury)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The sweet PDA came just a few weeks after Caroline revealed on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the series premiere</a> of The Real Housewives of Dubai that she didn’t feel the need to marry Sergio. “In my mind, I would have had no marriage. You know, I’m fine. I’m good,” Caroline told co-star<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Nina</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ali</strong></a>. She then said Sergio was the one who wanted an official wedding. “I think especially with the age difference — I mean, I’m 43 and he’s 27 — so many people think he’s a toy boy. You know what I mean? So I think for him, to validate himself to be like, you know, ‘I’m a proper person.
