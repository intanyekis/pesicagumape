Marti Noxon told People:</p><p>“We never asked her to lose a certain amount of weight.”</p><p>However, Lily, 31 was determined to transform her body for the role. She wanted to fully embrace the character.</p><p>She explained:</p><p>“It’s something that I decided to do as an actor for a role. You lose weight, you gain weight, you change your hair color.

The director and producers thought it better to recruit a nutrition expert for Lily.</p><p>Marti said:</p><p>“We had her work with a nutritionist, who actually worked with her throughout the entire process and for months after who, as she was gaining the weight back, was checking with her all the time.”</p><p>It is learned that Marti and her team had used special effects, make-up, and prosthetics to give Lily the thin and lean look.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_film_reviews></span><u>The film reviews</u><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The film has received a score of 7.3/10 on IMDb.

Concern petitions were filed but did not gain much momentum.</p><p>However, Noxon was upset that people were reacting and giving opinions even before the film is out and has been seen by them in toto.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33329E6100000578-3542024-image-a-116_1460731624608dm.jpg><p>The CEO of the Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness, Johanna Kandel, voiced her concern:</p><p>“There’s a very, very, very fine line between giving information about eating disorders and disclosing too much and being triggering for individuals who are currently struggling. The calorie counting, getting on the scale — all of those behaviors can bring everything back up and start that inner conversation to go, ‘I should do this’ again.”</p><p>The film has been released for a mature audience only. But many still feel that it could serve as fodder for the pro-anorexic community. They feel that the film has failed to bring home the point and this could be dangerous.</p><p>You may like to read <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Lily Collins relationships, breakups, and rumors.
