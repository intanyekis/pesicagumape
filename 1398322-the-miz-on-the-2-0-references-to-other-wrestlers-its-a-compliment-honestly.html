When asked about other wrestlers being referred to as “Miz 2.0,” The Hollywood A-Lister takes it as a compliment.</p><p>“I never thought that people would say, ‘Oh, this is just another Miz,'” The Miz said. “I never thought I would get to that level, where people would be like, ‘Oh, they’re just a knockoff, Miz 2.0.’ It’s a compliment honestly, and for that person that’s getting that, it’s a compliment to them honestly.”</p><p>When asked how surreal it is to think about everything he’s accomplished in WWE, Miz admitted he never thought he’d be where he is in his wildest dreams.</p><p>“Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d ever be sitting here, 20 years into WWE, having won every title there is to win multiple times. If you had told me that as a kid, I would have laughed at you,” The Miz admitted. “I would have said no way, no how. In High School, I was like 120 pounds soaking wet. There’s just no possible way that’s going to happen.</p><h2 id=h-the-miz-reflects-on-his-journey-from-the-real-world-to-wwe>The Miz reflects on his journey from the Real World To WWE</h2><p>“Something happens in life. I think there are always these different roads you can take. My road, I will never forget, I was in my college fraternity, watching the Real World, and it said try out, and I was like I’m going to try out, even though everyone said no way are you going to make it. I still said I’m going to try out.</p><p>“Once I tried out and made it on to there, I realized, what do I want to do with my life? I can either go back to college and do that route, or I can go pursue something that I am truly passionate about and truly love. So, I decided to do that, and I learned the art of professional wrestling. Worked on the indies for like three years and worked my way up.”</p><p><a href=#>Ric Flair: The Miz Really Cares For The Business, He Makes Everything Work</a></p><p>What do you make of The Miz’s comments?
