Although true when looking at nothing but the numbers, there's more to it than that. Very rough projections have Bezos breaking the trillion-dollar barrier by the year 2025, and although he will likely surpass that number one day, chances are it won't be quite that soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>No, Jeff Bezos Is Not About To Become The World's First Trillionaire</a></span></p><p>As for the fictional world of the Marvel Universe, well, that realm has had a trillionaire for a while. Ask fans to guess who that trillionaire might be and they'd probably guess Tony Stark aka Iron Man, or perhaps even Hank Pym. Both are millionaire, maybe even billionaires, but neither is a trillionaire.</p><p>Marvel's richest hero is actually King T'Challa, better known to moviegoers and comic book readers as Black Panther. T'Challa has the benefit of ruling the fictional nation of Wakanda. The African country was struck by a meteorite made of Vibranium before the superhero was even born. The made-up material is what makes his suit so special, and is also what Captain America's shield is made from.</p><p>via The New Yorker</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To give readers an idea of how much Vibranium is worth in the Marvel Universe, it is mentioned more than once that the ultra-rare metal fetches $10,000 per gram. That's more than 300 times more valuable than the most expensive metal on Earth, Rhodium, and five times as valuable as diamond which fetches $2000 per gram. It's that high price tag people have used to estimate the net worth of Wakanda, and therefore its king. A very cool $90.7 trillion.</p><p>Even though Bezos is on course to become the world's first trillionaire, he isn't the richest person in the world right now. That honor goes to Bill Gates who is currently worth around $86 billion. King T'Challa is worth more than 1000 times that amount. Good job Vibranium doesn't really exist, although if it did, we would want someone with the dignity and decision-making skills of Black Panther to be the one in charge of it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fridge Or Cupboard: Cadbury Settles Where Is Best To Store Chocolate</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8GlmJyjXaWur8DHnqlmpZGnw6a4jKugnKCVqMFutMSrpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
