At the same time, they express hope of finding your next great love with the help of a delicious drink.</p><p>Malone first teased the song in May when he shared a snippet of the lyrics via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a> quickly expressed her excitement, writing in the comments section, “Can’t handle this much cool and cute!! Super fan alert!”</p><p>More recently, he played the song with Shelton at Nissan Stadium as part of <a href=#>CMA Fest</a>. They also performed a stripped-down acoustic rendition at Shelton’s Ole Red Bar during the Spotify House takeover.</p><p>“Welcome to country music @postmalone!!!!!” Shelton wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on June 7 after the performances. “Hell of a time 🍻.”</p><p></p><p>“Pour Me a Drink” is the latest track to be released from Malone’s upcoming country album, <i>F-1 Trillion</i>. He confirmed earlier this week that the 18-track project will arrive on August 16 with preorders available now.</p><p>The album is expected to include Malone’s hit single with <strong>Morgan Wallen</strong>, “<a href=#>I Had Some Help</a>,” which has quickly been climbing the charts. While the track made its official debut in May, concert attendees at the <a href=#>2024 Stagecoach Music Festival</a> in California were able to get a tease during Wallen’s set one month earlier.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although some music fans may know Malone for his hits like “Sunflower,” “Congratulations” and “Circles,” the Grammy nominee has been open about his love and appreciation for country music.</p><p>While appearing on the “Joe Rogan Experience” <a href=# rel=noopener>podcast</a>, Malone praised <strong>Zach Bryan</strong>, <strong>Sturgill Simpson</strong>, <strong>Tyler Childers</strong> and <strong>Colter Wall</strong> for their country music talents. He also expressed how much he appreciates the traditional country sound.</p><p>“The whole <strong>Johnny Cash</strong> … he always sang murder ballads, you know what I mean? It’s like, I shot a f–kin’ dude in Reno, I shot the guy that my wife loves, all this s–t,” he explained in August 2023. “It’s the old-school production, it’s the old-school voice. And I find a lot of the time in country now, it’s very overproduced. What I love about Colter and Tyler and everything is it’s just more traditional in that way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeoq6RiuqK4zqecZqGjYrSwtc2gZJynpaPBs8WMsKCtoF2jsrh5wKWZrqVdlrulecGlmKSdXai1prjTqKVmq5%2BjtHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
