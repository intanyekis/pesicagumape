The main reason people often mistake their relationship is because of their last name.</p><p>Not only did they share last names but also their nationality. Both of them are from Canada and are highly revered names in Hollywood. Shawn was born in Montreal but Eugene was from Hamilton.</p><p>The common thing they share is their love for movies. They enjoy all the aspect of this art form and has been able to show their talent through it.

Dan is Eugene’s son.</p><p>Dan is also a very successful actor, who has been loved in his hit shows like Schitt’s Creek, where he acted alongside Shwan, his real father.
