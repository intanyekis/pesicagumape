However, KOCH Ent. label execs allegedly told the artist that he was actually given a $60K check to put towards repairs, renovations, etc. He claims he never received the check, leading him to believe Styles, <a href=# id=auto-tag_sheek-louch data-tag=sheek-louch>Sheek Louch</a> or DJ Supa Mario (whom he claims were authorized to sign on his behalf) may have pocketed the label’s donation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Ghost, highly offended by the questioning of his character, took to social media to address Hood’s claims, saying that he isn’t owed a dime from the crew that, “made you into the artist you are.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Here it is 20 years later,” Styles said. “Louch been in your house to fight your father for you before. Ni**as gave your mother money when your house burned down. We actually made you into the artist you are. Louch used to argue with Flex to play your sh*t, but you’re owed 60 G’s?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The lyricist went on to describe the “sucker sh*t” J-Hood allegedly put the group through <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">regarding his publishing.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The label didn’t really want to f**k with you but you’re owed 60 G’s? And the sucker sh*t that I ain’t even say, you know you not, you ain’t owed 60 G’s cause you tried to f**king sue us.

I’m really disappointed in J-Hood, to be honest with you.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hoffa replied to Styles’ remarks within the comment section of a reposted clip, writing, “Since we doing internet sh*t… I’ll respond then maybe JoJo can give me ya # (cuz I don’t have it) or maybe Kiss can answer his text or The week I held the interview Sheek could’ve reached back but it’s all love.
