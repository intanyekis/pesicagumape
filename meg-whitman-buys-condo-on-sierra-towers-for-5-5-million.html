She is a board member of Procter & Gamble and General Motors. Whitman was previously president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Meg Whitman bought a $6.5 million West Hollywood condo. Two years later, the billionaire businesswoman and current U.S. Ambassador to Kenya tried to offload her stylish unit for the exact price she paid for it, but the condo didn’t sell. Now the place has popped up for sale again, this time with a significantly reduced ask of nearly $5.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b> Nick Cannon Reportedly Hospitalized With Pneumonia</b></a></span></p><p>Purchased by Whitman and her neurosurgeon husband Griffith Harsh IV in August 2020, the southwest-facing unit lies on 24th floor of L.A.’s celeb-studded Sierra Towers skyscraper.
