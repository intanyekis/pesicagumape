Yes, the show had some <a href=#>bad episodes</a>, and even ones that were <a href=#>legitimately uncomfortable to watch</a>, but at the end of the day, the good outweighed the bad, and the show has gone down as a classic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, because the show is still popular, it gets discussed a lot. Many people do love the show, but plenty of others feel like it's completely overrated.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at both sides of this argument and learn why some people don't click with the show.</p><h2 id=39-the-office-39-is-a-classic>'The Office' Is A Classic</h2><p>In 2005, NBC rolled the dice on The Office, a mockumentary sitcom based on the legendary BBC series. There is no telling how an adaptation will go over with a new audience, but NBC struck gold when The Office caught on with fans.</p><p>Starring Steve Carell and a talented cast of performers ready to become stars, the series had a slow first season, but it found a groove in season two. Once people saw how good it could be, they helped turn the show into a powerhouse on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For 9 seasons and just over 200 episodes, the show dominated its competition, serving as the blueprint for other shows that followed. Even now, it's still incredibly popular, something that other shows of the era can't claim.</p><p>Given its lasting fan base and popularity, it goes without saying that there are millions out there who adore this show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>John Krasinski Wore A Wig In Season 3 Of 'The Office' And Nobody Noticed</a></span></p><h2 id=the-office-has-a-huge-fanbase>The Office Has A Huge Fanbase</h2><p>When looking at many shows that people still stream on the regular, it's pretty difficult to find one as popular as The Office. Simply put, people keep coming back to the show because they can't get enough of it, and the show's popularity is also able to thrive because it manages to attract new fans every single year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On fan dished on their love of the show, saying how often they watched it.</p><p>"Put it this way before they took the office off of Netflix I literally watched the office every day from start to finish over and over and over and over again and when it came on TV I watched it and now that it's on peacock I watch it no matter what I will always watch the office it will never not be funny," they wrote.</p><p>When responding to a question regarding the show being their favorite of all time, on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user pointed out that, while the show is their favorite, it's hardly the best show that they've ever seen.</p><p>"Its the only show that I can re-watch numerous times without getting sick of it. Is it my favorite? Yes , but its not the best show I've ever seen," the user wrote.</p><p>Other people, however, feel quite differently about the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has Hollywood Turned Their Backs On These ‘The Office’ Actors?</a></span></p><h2 id=certain-reddit-fans-have-a-theory-about-the-office-being-overrated>Certain Reddit Fans Have A Theory About The Office Being Overrated</h2><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, one user kicked off a thread by discussing the show and how they just don't understand why people enjoy it.</p><p>"I have tried to watch this show many tines. Each attempt has left me laugh-less and with a sense of second hand embarrassment for the actors who are trying way to hard to be funny. The jokes feel very forced to me, which is something I just can not get past. Apart from the delivery, the quality of humour is also really childish and unfunny. Seriously one of the most braindead things I have watched," they wrote.</p><p>Another user agreed with this post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Oh my gosh finally. I agree one hundred percent and everyone I've attempted to discuss the show with always tells me I haven't 'watched the right episodes'. It's so refreshing to finally hear someone else state that it's not actually funny, just really uncomfortable and not even entertaining," the user wrote.</p><p>Of course, this is all subjective, but the more popular something gets, the more vocal people will be about their distaste for it.</p><p>Hilariously, another user in that thread took someone's advice about skipping the first season, and the results served as a warning for others.</p><p>"I felt the same way and mentioned I couldn’t make it past the first few episodes. Then someone on reddit suggested skipping to the 2nd season because the characters are more developed and show has figured itself out. So I watched the first few episodes of the 2nd season. Don’t make the same mistake I did. It was still terrible and definitely not funny," they said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What B.J.
