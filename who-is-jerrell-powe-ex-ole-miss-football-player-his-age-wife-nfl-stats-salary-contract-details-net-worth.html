The 35 year old is currently unmarried.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The defensive tackle made 89 tackles during his senior season of competition, nine of which were quarterbacks. He also forced five fumbles. Powe eventually received All-American honors from Parade and USA Today as a result.</p><p>Powe was ranked as the nation’s third-best defensive line prospect when he entered college. Although he was courted by many schools, he chose to enrol at Ole Miss instead of Auburn, LSU, or Texas A&M.</p><p>Powe played in 37 games from 2008 to 2010 and recorded 69 tackles, seven sacks, and an interception. He was recognised as Second-Team All-Southeastern Conference in 2009 and 2010.</p><h4>Jerrell Powe draft</h4><p>Powe was formerly considered to be the best nose tackle prospect in college football, but his performance suffered, and by the 2011 NFL Draft, he was only considered to be a second- or third-round player.</p><p>Powe was 24 at the time as well, which is a high age for an NFL rookie. In the end, he was chosen in the sixth round by the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h4>Jerrell Powe team</h4><p>After being selected by the Kansas City Chiefs, Powe discovered that there were little opportunities for him to enter the starting lineup, and he frequently served as a backup nose tackle.</p><p>For the Chiefs, he appeared in 12 games over the course of three seasons, recording eight tackles and one sack. In 2013, his final season with the Chiefs, he was twice cut and re-registered before he eventually left to join the Houston Texans in 2014.</p><p>Powe made 10 tackles while playing for the Texans in 16 games.</p><p>Powe signed on with the then-Washington Redskins on June 1 of the following year.</p><h4>Jerrell Powe net worth</h4><p>Powe has an estimated net worth of $5 million from his time in the NFL, according to Forbes and Business Insider, despite a halting career.</p><table id=save-dynamic-table border=1><tbody><tr><td data-rowid=0 data-columnid=0>YEAR</td><td data-rowid=0 data-columnid=1>TEAM</td><td data-rowid=0 data-columnid=2>SALARY</td><td data-rowid=0 data-columnid=3>EARNINGS</td></tr><tr><td data-rowid=1 data-columnid=0>2011</td><td data-rowid=1 data-columnid=1>Kansas City Chiefs</td><td data-rowid=1 data-columnid=2>$375,000</td><td data-rowid=1 data-columnid=3>$453,680</td></tr><tr><td data-rowid=2 data-columnid=0>2012</td><td data-rowid=2 data-columnid=1>Kansas City Chiefs</td><td data-rowid=2 data-columnid=3>$465,000</td><td data-rowid=3 data-columnid=0>$473,500</td></tr><tr><td data-rowid=3 data-columnid=1>2013</td><td data-rowid=3 data-columnid=2>Kansas City Chiefs</td><td data-rowid=4 data-columnid=0><p>$65, 294</p></td><td data-rowid=4 data-columnid=2>$65, 294</td></tr><tr><td data-rowid=4 data-columnid=3>2014</td><td data-rowid=5 data-columnid=0>Houston Texans</td><td data-rowid=5 data-columnid=1><p><span>$645,000</span></p></td><td data-rowid=5 data-columnid=3>$645,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In his debut year, Powe received a&nbsp;signing bonus of $78,680, earning a total of around $450 hundred thousand and in 2012, he also received a workout bonus worth $8,500.
