Kelly, 53, grabbed a bouquet of flowers off a nearby coffee table and produced a set of rings before Mark, 52, began with the vows.</p><p>“I just have a few questions. Theresa, do you plan to cherish and honor Gerry in sickness and in health?” Mark asked before posing the same question to Gerry. The couple, who <a href=#>got engaged</a> during the Golden Bachelor season 1 finale last month, both agreed.</p><p>“And Gerry, do you plan to love Theresa now and forever?” Mark continued.</p><p>“Oh, I do plan to love her now and forever,” Gerry said, taking his time with the sentiment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gerry-Turner-and-Theresa-Nist-Get-Fake-Married-By-Mark-Consuelos.jpg><p>“You better,” Theresa joked before echoing the same vow.</p><p>Mark then declared, “By the authority vested in me by the show of Live with Kelly and Mark, I pronounce you husband and wife,” as Theresa laughingly protested, “No, wait, we’re not ready.”</p><p>Kelly wrapped up the unofficial ceremony by telling Gerry and Theresa, “You may now suck on your ring pops.” The duo laughed as Mark dubbed the fake nuptials “a rehearsal.”</p><p>Gerry and Theresa are set to tie the knot for real during the televised special <a href=#>The Golden Wedding</a>, which airs on ABC Thursday, January 4. During a November appearance on the “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast, Gerry defended the twosome’s decision to fast track the wedding.</p><p>“We’re old! Think about it this way: You can wait a year in your 20s because that might be 3 percent of your remaining life,” he said. “When you’re in your 70s, a year could be 10 percent or 20 percent of the time you have left.”</p><p>The retired restaurateur added that the pair “didn’t want to put off” something that they “really felt was right.”</p><p>Theresa was one of 22 women who vied for Gerry’s affection during the first season of The Golden Bachelor, which premiered in September. After <a href=#>breaking things off</a> with runner-up <strong>Leslie Fhima</strong>, Gerry proposed to Theresa — but not before faking her out first.</p><p>“When I woke up this morning, it was difficult. I had really mixed feelings, and I got to the point with the questions I had asked myself about, how did I get here? And is she the right girl? I came to the realization that you’re not the right person for me to live with,” Gerry said during the finale before getting down on one knee. “You’re the person that I can’t live without. Theresa, I love you 1,000 percent. I’m never going to stop believing that every day I choose you. Will you marry me?”</p><p>Ahead of the romantic moment, Theresa gushed about her hopes for a future with Gerry.</p><p>“I feel that for us that life isn’t over, that the best is yet to come. I think you are the most wonderful man in the world,” she said. “Now that I’ve found you, I don’t ever want to let you go. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”</p><p>Gerry was previously married to his high school sweetheart, Toni, until she died of a bacterial infection in 2017. They shared two daughters, Jenny and Angie.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Theresa, meanwhile, was also previously married to her high school sweetheart, Billy, who died in 2014. They shared two children, son Tommy and daughter Jen.</p><p>The Golden Wedding will air on ABC Thursday, January 4, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6eqqKuerXB0aecq2WRo7FuwMeeqZ6rkWK7qr%2FTZp6erF2brqyxjKaYq6qZmrFurthmpJqqm2KwsLrSrpylp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
