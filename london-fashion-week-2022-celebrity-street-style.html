London Fashion Week is officially in high gear — and the stars are serving up chic ensembles, edgy attire and fashion-forward looks on repeat.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>With designers like Richard Quinn, Molly Goddard, Simone Rocha and Raf Simmons sending new collections down the catwalk, it’s no surprise that stars from around the world set off to sit front row.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Celebrations for the week kicked off on Thursday, February 17, with the Clearpay Opening Night Party, which was held at The Cockatoo at Bistrotheque.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The star-studded evening was attended by fashion week staple <a href=#><strong>Irina Shayk</strong></a>. The 36-year-old model was a co-host for the event — and she obviously dressed to impress. Shayk stunned in a sleek Burberry dress and thigh-high leather boots, all designed by the fashion house’s creative director Ricardo Tisci.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While her street style was simple and sleek, the Sports Illustrated model was all about being over-the-top on the Matty Bovan runway show on Friday, February 18.
