The glittery trousers featured a silver button, a high-waisted fit and seamless pockets. He paired the piece with a sheer tank top, a white undershirt and a sleek leather jacket. Jonas looked <a href=#>extra handsome</a> with his brunette locks styled in a wet ‘do. He completed his getup with silver chunky rings and Nike sneakers.</p><p>“Thank you to everyone for all of the birthday love 🖤,” he captioned the post.</p><p>Jonas also donned the outfit while performing on Sunday, August 13, at <a href=#>Yankee Stadium</a> during The Tour with the <a href=#>Jonas Brothers,</a> which includes his siblings<a href=#> <strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a>.</p><p>While Joe’s sparkly slacks proved to be a look to remember, his other <a href=#>on-stage outfits</a> were just as dazzling.</p><p>Elsewhere during the Sunday concert, he rocked a funky Canadian tuxedo, featuring colorful patches and furry embroidery. The <a href=#>denim jacket</a> included heart-shaped embellishments and the trousers were finished with stars.</p><p>At the Saturday, August 12, show, Joe told the crowd, “I’ve always wanted to start something at a baseball stadium.” He explained, “I just feel like it’d be kinda cool to watch <a href=#>Jonas Brother fans</a> start the wave.” Nick, 30, meanwhile, tried to give an <a href=#>emotional speech</a> before performing their song “Turn Right,” but fans interrupted his words with the silly move.</p><p>Nick attempted to return the crowd’s focus to his speech, saying, “Look I know y’all trying to do the wave, but I just want to tell you this one thing and then we can get back to the wave.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The next night, a fan asked Joe to again start the wave before Nick played “Turn Right,” but he shook his head and said no. He then gave Nick a side eye and raised his eyebrows, seemingly saying he was not amused by the wave.</p><p>The kicking off their string of shows in the Big Apple, the Jonas Brothers are slated to serenade fans around the country, performing five albums per night.&nbsp;The set list includes 67 songs, totaling to a three-hour long concert.
