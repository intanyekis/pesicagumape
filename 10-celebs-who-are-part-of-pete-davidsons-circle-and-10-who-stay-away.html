In it, the comedian spoke in-depth and candidly about, among many things, his past relationships. Specifically, his past relationships with notable celebrities and how he thinks he messed them up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This interview was the rawest and most honest that we have ever seen of Davidson yet and untapped a whole new side of him that we never saw before. Most importantly, his candidness really gave us a look into not only his mind, but his friend circle. He gave us an idea of which of his exes he remains friends with and which of his exes are simply exed out of his life. Using that information and some extra sources we scoured the internet for, we cooked up a list of celebs who are in his circle and which he stays away from.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-charlamagne-tha-god><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Charlamagne Tha God</strong></span></h2><p>Even before he got the morning radio show host to provide him a tell-all interview, Pete Davidson goes way back with Charlamagne Tha God. The Breakfast Club leader has worked with Davidson on a number of shows for MTV, as well as let Davidson come onto his podcast, The Brilliant Idiots, as a guest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stays-away-from-ariana-grande><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From: Ariana Grande</strong></span></h2><p>Everyone was expecting her as an entrant on this side of the list, so let's get Ariana Grande out the way immediately. Davidson has not been on the best of terms with his ex-fiance since she broke off their engagement and he's let it show on social media by dropping subtle shots of shade her way every once in a while.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-john-mulaney><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: John Mulaney</strong></span></h2><p>Perhaps due to the mantra expressing that all comedians should stick together, two completely different styles of comedy in Pete Davidson and John Mulaney have managed to become friends over time. On top of showing up to basketball games together, they even wear matching clothes and hang out all of the time.</p><h2 id=stays-away-from-kaia-gerber><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Kaia Gerber</strong></span></h2><p>In one of many oddball couplings that Pete Davidson has been a part of, he briefly dated Kaia Gerber, a model and the daughter of the world-famous Cindy Crawford. In the interview with Charlamagne Tha God, Davidson said they broke up after four months due to his own personal struggles right before he went to rehab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-machine-gun-kelly><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Machine Gun Kelly</strong></span></h2><p>On paper, a rapper of MGK's magnitude and a comedian of Pete Davidson's magnitude could not draw more polar opposites. However, as two mutual bros, they could not be closer in bond. In fact, both have referred to each other as best friends, surprisingly enough. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two met </a>when MGK guest-starred on Wild 'n' Out and have been inseparable since then.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Demi Lovato And Machine Gun Kelly An Item?</a></span></p><h2 id=stays-away-from-kate-beckinsale><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Kate Beckinsale</strong></span></h2><p>This one still has us scratching our heads. How a 26-year-old up and coming comedian stole the heart of a 46-year-old professional vampire (or at least she plays one in movies) is anyone's guess. While Davidson gave glowing remarks about his ex in the Charlamagne interview, it does not appear as though the two are on speaking terms at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-kid-cudi><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Kid Cudi</strong></span></h2><p>In addition to just attending Kid Cudi's 35th birthday party, the musician is just someone who the comedian looks up to. In 2016, during an interview with The Breakfast Club, he admitted “I truly believe if <i>Man on the Moon</i> didn’t come out, I wouldn’t be here. He saved my life. I would’ve killed myself if I didn’t have Kid Cudi.”</p><h2 id=stays-away-from-cazzie-david><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Cazzie David</strong></span></h2><p>Another surprising name on Pete Davidson's ex list, Cazzie David is the daughter of Larry David from Curb Your Enthusiasm. After dating on and off for years, they finally ended it in 2018. For anyone wondering where they stand now, Cazzie's mom told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Us Weekly</a> that Davidson was "no longer in [Cazzie's] consciousness."</p><h2 id=inner-ross-butler><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Inner: Ross Butler</strong></span></h2><p>Back when they were still an item, Pete Davidson and his then-girlfriend Ariana Grande were invited guests to Kanye West's listening party for his latest album (with Kid Cudi) called Kids See Ghosts. There, he linked up with Ross Butler, the former star of Riverdale and the current star of Netflix's 13 Reasons Why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stays-away-from-john-mayer><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: John Mayer</strong></span></h2><p>As a guy who used to make guest appearances on MTV's Guy Code, Pete Davidson knows just as well as anyone about what the bro code is about. He might suspect John Mayer broke the bro code when news broke out that he was trying to date Davidson's ex, Cazzie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Celebs John Mayer Is Surprisingly Friends With</a></span></p><h2 id=inner-circle-dave-chappelle><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Dave Chappelle&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>An unnamed source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> in 2018 that heading into the holiday season that year, Dave Chappelle invited Pete Davidson to his Ohio house in the woods to cheer him up about Ariana Grande dumping him. Apparently, Big Dave is something of a mentor to the young man.</p><h2 id=stays-away-from-vinnie-brand><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Vinnie Brand</strong></span></h2><p>In April of 2019, Pete Davidson walked out on a comedy show run by Vinnie Brand after Brand introduced him as the ex of Kate Beckinsale and Ariana Grande. Not wanting to be defined by his romances, Davidson was furious and called them out publicly on social media. Reasonably, Brand publicly apologized, but it wasn't enough to mend old wounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-carly-aquilino><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Carly Aquilino</strong></span></h2><p>Another MTV alumi, Carly Aquilino befriended Davidson in 2013 before the pair decided to date in 2014, although they broke up by 2015. No worries, though. Unlike most of Davidson's exes, Aquilino and Davidson are still friends to this day, even snapping pics at comedy shows together for the 'Gram.</p><h2 id=stays-away-from-chris-distefano><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Chris DiStefano</strong></span></h2><p>Before Carly Aquilino&nbsp;even started dating Pete Davidson, she was dating another frequent MTV show cast member in comedian Chris DiStefano between 2010 and 2014. While Davidson may have no qualms with DiStefano himself, DiStefano may have some beef for some reason Davidson might beef with John Mayer: for breaking the bro code.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-kanye-west><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Kanye West</strong></span></h2><p>We mentioned earlier that Pete Davidson attended Kid Cudi's 35th birthday party awhile back. Other attendees there were actor Timothee&nbsp;Chalamet (we know, it's random) and Kanye West. West and Davidson actually have a friendship among themselves, all after squashing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter beef</a> they had in the past over Ariana Grande.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According To Kanye West: Here's What It's Like Being Married To Kim Kardashian</a></span></p><h2 id=stays-away-from-louis-ck><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Louis CK</strong></span></h2><p>In the Charlamagne interview, when he wasn't talking about his exes, Davidson was talking about how much he hated Louis CK. The reason being because during the former's host stint, CK was uncomfortable with Davidson's weed usage, and opted to tell SNL's Lorne Michaels, apparently trying to get Davidson fired.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-nick-cannon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Nick Cannon</strong></span></h2><p>Nick Cannon played a big part in Pete Davidson's early career success after bringing him to the cast of Wild 'n' Out when Davidson was young. Clearly, that is something that Davidson will always be grateful for as the two are still friends to this day and he tries to praise Cannon publicly whenever he has the chance.</p><h2 id=stays-away-from-dan-crenshaw><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>: Dan Crenshaw</strong></span></h2><p>The politician isn't going to like this one. Perhaps the worst stint of controversy in Davidson's career came when he made an ill-advised joke at war veteran Dan Crenshaw's expense. In his new Netflix comedy special, Davidson recalled how he felt he was "forced" to apologize and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> basically took his apology back on the stage.&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-margaret-qualley><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Inner Circle: Margaret Qualley</strong></span></h2><p>Margaret Qualley may be best known for her stint on HBO's The Leftovers and for her supporting role in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but she also briefly dated Pete Davidson last year for just two months. Although, it has been reported that the two decided to remain friends after.</p><h2 id=stays-away-from-snl-staff><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Stays Away From</strong><strong>:&nbsp;SNL Staff</strong></span></h2><p>One of the most interesting tidbits that Davidson revealed in his recent tell-all interview with Charlamagne Tha God is about what he thinks the SNL cast think about him. In only so many expletives, he said that he feels like they think he's dumb and joke about him while he's away; noting how they cracked jokes on the first two episodes he missed this past fall. If true, his time on the show may be running out.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Flashy Cars Likely To Get You Pulled Over</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnPmqmtZZ%2BberGx055knZmmnrG0u82sZJyhopi5pnnAp5tmaWBixKm7jKyrmrFdlsSixY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
