From small, discreet designs to large, bold statements, celebrities have used tattoos to tell their stories and share their passions. But not all tattoos are created equal, and some celebrity tattoos have become infamous for their questionable designs or placement.<span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>These Celebrities Have The Wildest Tattoos</a></span>Here's a look at some of the top celebrity tattoos that have caught the attention of millions of people. Let's explore the tattoos that are inspiring and meaningful, as well as those that are cringe-worthy and make us wonder what the celebrity was thinking. So whether you're looking for inspiration for your next tattoo or just want to see some of the most interesting celebrity ink, these artistic choices are worth checking out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-and-his-giant-phoenix-which-he-told-everyone-was-fake><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ben Affleck And His Giant Phoenix (Which He Told Everyone Was Fake)</span></h2><p>Ben Affleck was once photographed at the beach, revealing a giant phoenix tattoo on his back. At first the actor denied the tattoo was real, but after paparazzi got more photos of the large piece of ink, it was clear that his tattoo was real. And many think the tattoo isn't very good.</p><p>Even his current wife, Jennifer Lopez ridiculed the artwork <a href=#>in an interview in 2016</a>, calling it "awful." The singer went on to explain that the piece had too many colors. While that may be true, the tattoo just doesn't flow very well with Ben Affleck's back. It just doesn't look right.</p><p>The actor has explained that his tattoo is meaningful to him so whether you hate his ink or love it, the only thing that matters is that Ben Affleck appreciates it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-and-her-many-feminine-tattoos><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ariana Grande And Her Many Feminine Tattoos</span></h2><p>Typically, tattoo artists refuse to ink up client's hands if they aren't heavily tattooed everywhere else. But it's Ariana Grande and let's face it, her hand tattoos are super cute. Her squiggle moon is unique and pairs lovely with her "Toulouse" script right next to it. Plus, the little leaves along her fingers are a nice touch as well.</p><p>Moving on to her butterflies... <a href=#>She removed them</a>! We don't know why because they were adorable. Maybe the singer just didn't resonate with the ink after a few years. But no matter, they were still one of our favorite tattoos on celebrity skin!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariana Grande Celebrated 'May The 4th Be With You' By Showing Off Her Butterfly Tattoos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-sheeran-and-his-hodgepodge><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ed Sheeran And His Hodgepodge</span></h2><p>Ed Sheeran has a lot of tattoos... Many of which do not flow together at all, especially the pieces on his torso. Some notable tattoos that just aren't great on the English singer's body include an image of a couple making out and a sleeve that just doesn't make any sense. But it seems like Ed Sheeran loves his tattoos, which is all that matters.</p><h2 id=chris-brown-and-his-poor-artistic-choice><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris Brown And His Poor Artistic Choice</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not a secret that the hip hop and R&B singer went to jail in 2009 after beating his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, after an altercation in his car. Images of Rihanna's face badly bruised circulated the internet. After all the drama subsided, Chris Brown decided to get a neck tattoo that looks like a woman with a black eye. It probably wasn't his intention to look like it, but it does. And it's not a good look.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-and-her-matching-friendship-tattoos><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Selena Gomez And Her Matching Friendship Tattoos</span></h2><p>Selena Gomez has a handful of tattoos, and many of them are matching pieces with some of her closest friends. Our personal favorite of hers (and Cara Delevingne's) is the watercolor rose ripping down her back. But her other ink is also super cute. And it's so wholesome that she gets friendship tattoos with her closest gal pals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selena Gomez's Tattoo Artist Shows Off Her New Dripping Rose Tattoo</a></span></p><h2 id=audrina-patridge-and-her-tattoo-that-we-can-t-figure-out><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Audrina Patridge And Her Tattoo That We Can't Figure Out</span></h2><p>Apparently it's supposed to be a snake wrapped around an apple? It's not super clear what the piece is supposed to be, and the colors are atrocious. Hopefully <a href=#>Audrina Paridge</a> is a fan of her tattoo. But if she isn't, it's okay, she can't view it most of the time as it's located on her back.</p><h2 id=the-tattoo-that-s-just-as-famous-as-the-celebrity><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Tattoo That's Just As Famous As The Celebrity</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When people think of Mike Tyson, they think of boxing, and they think of <a href=#>that giant tattoo on the side of his face</a>. The tribal art might be more recognizable at this point than the actual celebrity showcasing it. Love it or hate it, it's one of the most identifiable tattoos in ink history.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato-and-her-dark-ink><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Demi Lovato And Her Dark Ink</span></h2><p>Demi Lovato has a lot of tattoos at this point in her life, and many of them are super cool. The<a href=#> giant spider on her head</a> is very well done, unfortunately we can't see it unless the singer shaves her head. Either way, the piece is still amazing. Some of the artist's other tattoos that are top-tier include her gothic font script pieces and a spiderweb on her shoulder. Demi Lovato definitely has great style when it comes to the ink on her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmq5qspKS8tHnToZitZZGnsm6zzqibZqeiYrCztc2gnGavn6fBqcWMmqmimZ6Weqi%2BwKebnmWSmrturcWfo56bm2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
