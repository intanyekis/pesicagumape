Boateng from Savage, Maryland, was reported missing. The Rehoboth Beach Police Department released a statement indicating that Richard had last been seen in the ocean surf off the beach near Rehoboth Avenue at around 5:45 pm that Sunday.</p><p>The search for Richard took a grim turn on the morning of September 4, 2023, just before 6 am. Officials from the Rehoboth Beach Police Department, Delaware State Parks Enforcement Division, and Rehoboth Beach Volunteer Fire Department responded to a report of a human body found in the surf.</p><p>In a heartbreaking update on Facebook, the Rehoboth Beach Police announced the tragic discovery of Richard Boateng’s lifeless body on the beach, specifically in the North Shores community in the vicinity of Ocean Drive & Farview Road.</p><p>Authorities had issued an initial description of Richard to aid in the search efforts. He was described as 5’10” tall, with black hair, brown eyes, and weighing approximately 170 pounds. Richard was last seen wearing a bright blue and white swimsuit adorned with a floral design and a blue swim cap.</p><p>The incident unfolded approximately 22 minutes after lifeguards had concluded their duty on September 3, 2023. A massive and concerted effort involving multiple agencies and spanning several hours was launched in response to numerous 911 calls reporting Richard’s disappearance.</p><p>A witness named Mohan, who was on the beach, recounted the tragic moment when he realized Richard was in distress: “I thought somebody was waving his hand. Probably he was shouting ‘help’ and we suddenly realized, yeah, he needs help. So then I started shouting ‘Help! We need a lifeguard.’ We were shouting, shouting, shouting, and finally when I turned to this side. I can’t see him. He just lifted his hand and he drowned.”</p><p>The search efforts involved a collaborative operation, with contributions from the Rehoboth Beach Patrol, the fire department, the United States Coast Guard, the Delaware State Police Aviation Unit, the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife, and the Rehoboth Beach Police Department. The United States Coast Guard also participated in the ocean search.</p><p>Weather conditions added to the complexity of the situation, as Hurricane Franklin’s presence in the Atlantic Ocean prompted forecasters to issue warnings about rip currents. Rehoboth Beach had been under a double red flag warning, signifying a prohibition on ocean swimming, on Thursday and Friday due to concerns about rip currents and safety.</p><p>Approximately 30 miles away in Ocean City, Maryland, a similar scenario unfolded, with multiple rescues conducted by beach patrol members and fire department rescue swimmers. Reports indicate that around 150 rescues took place on Sunday alone, underscoring the gravity of the rip current and safety concerns along the coastline during this period of heightened risk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kv6qvx5qpnWWSpK61sc2gZKaho6i2r7OMrK6ipZ2av267xWakmqqpoa6vsIyfpq6mlGKxpq3DZqCnZaKatbCuzq2fZpqVlrCpecOeo5qvkaeycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
