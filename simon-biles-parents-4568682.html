I do remember always being hungry and afraid,” Simone said <a class="body-link hawk-link-parsed" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/parents/my-parents-saved-me-simone-biles-tearfully-opens-about-being-t110260 data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>during a TV appearance</a> while on&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;in 2017. Nellie and and Ronald then stepped in, telling Simone and her sister Adria to call them “mom” and “dad,” which Simone said they gladly did. (Ashley and Tevin were taken in by Ronald’s sister.)</p><p class=body-text>“I remember praying for that bonding,” Nellie once told Women’s Health of her experience as an adoptive parent. “Because telling them that you love them and you care for them; that’s all words. But then you wake up one day, and you realize that you would do anything for these children. And that you would die for these children. And when that feeling comes, that’s when you know you are truly a mother.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I knew I had my own barriers because these were not my biological children,” Nellie also revealed in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook Watch</a> series Simone vs. Herself. “You do everything that’s nurturing, that’s mothering, but emotionally, you still have to be there 100%,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>During the&nbsp;DWTS&nbsp;segment, Simone emphasized how Nellie and Ronald “saved” her, paving the way for her future and instilling the values she carries with her to this day.&nbsp;“They’ve set huge examples of how to treat other people, and they’ve been there to support me since day one,” she explained. “There’s nothing I could say to them to thank them enough.”</p><h2><strong><strong>Simone Keeps In Touch With Her Biological Mother Shannon&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Although it’s Ronald and Nellie who have served as Simone’s main parental figures, she still keeps in touch with her biological mother Shannon from time to time. In a 2016&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;interview, Shannon opened up about her difficult decision to give her children up for adoption. “It was hard to give up my kids, but I had to do what I had to. I wasn’t able to care for them,” the mother-of-four explained, adding that she and Simone sometimes have brief conversations and that she is “proud” of all she’s accomplished.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>During the interview, Shannon also shared that Simone’s biological father,&nbsp;<strong>Kelvin Clemons</strong>, has not kept in touch with Simone.</p><h2><strong><strong>Nellie & Ronald Own A Gymnastics Center&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Nellie and Ronald own a gymnastics center in Spring, Texas, called World Champions Centre. Simone also practices at the center, and a central tenet of the training ground is inclusivity, to welcome athletes from all races and backgrounds — something close to Simone’s heart. “Representation matters, and we want to inspire the next generation to pursue their passion,” the Olympian told <a class="body-link hawk-link-parsed" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.health.com/celebrities/simone-biles-interview data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Health</a>&nbsp;in June.</p><h2><strong><strong>They Weren’t Present At The Tokyo Olympics&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Unfortunately, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Nellie and Ronald were unable to attend the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to cheer on their daughter — something that was undoubtedly difficult for all parties involved. “[N]ot me crying on the plane because I’ll miss my family & friends,” Simone <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted in July</a> ahead of the event.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>not me crying on the plane because I’ll miss my family & friends</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 14, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Even though the pair couldn’t make <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the event</a> in-person, they obviously cheered on their girl at home, surrounded by family and friends. In addition, they showed their support on social media.&nbsp;“I am going to miss this but just know that I will be in Tokyo in spirit,” Nellie wrote in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>touching Instagram post</a> at the time.&nbsp;“May The Lord continue to guide and keep you.
