So here I am with mine out and about and proud.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ashley-Graham-swimsuitsforall-stretch-marks.jpg><p>The Nebraska native, who <a href=#>welcomed son Isaac</a> in January, revealed that she had to come to terms with her new physique after giving birth. “It looks so simple and beautiful but powerful. I’ve got more weight on me. I have stretch marks, and in the beginning, I really had to have a lot of conversations with myself and tell myself, ‘OK, new body, new mindset,’” she recalled. “But after this photo shoot, I felt so empowered because I was like, ‘Yes. I look good. I feel good. This is my new mom bod.’”</p><p>Graham divulged more details about the campaign on her Instagram account. “Some things I love: a cute bathing suit and a backyard shoot with the family!” she wrote on Wednesday. “We’ve had such [a] great time making the most of this summer in Nebraska and these suits have me feeling great for my first summer as a mommy!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, the&nbsp;American Beauty Star&nbsp;host shared intimate photos of <a href=#>her son breast-feeding</a>.
