His death news was provided through social media. <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lindsy Sprout</a></span> posted a statement on Facebook that begins,</p><p></p><p>“It’s a sad day in Kansas City learning of the passing of one of the most iconic entertainers this town has seen, spent countless birthdays and nights (and a few days) singing with Alan Latta and friends at the Cigar Box.</p><p>It was because of him that the Cigar Box has longtime been one of my favorite spots to head to when I needed a happy and fun time with friends.</p><p>It didn’t matter if a person could carry a tune (me) or not, he made everyone feel like they were awesome when he would point the microphone in their direction.</p><p>RIP Al…You will be missed! I’ll never see a sequined jacket or hear Sweet Caroline and not think of you and the smiles and joy you helped create!”</p><p>Condolences and sympathies to his family. Latta’s funeral details have not been made public.</p><h2><strong>About Al Latta:</strong></h2><p>Al Latta was a renowned entertainer and singer of Kansas City.&nbsp; When Al Latta entered for his performances on stage, the feeling of that room could not be disputed.</p><p>The audience was immediately drawn into his world because of his fantastic intensity. Instead of just playing music or providing entertainment, he wanted to build relationships with every concertgoer.</p><p>He performed by covering artists like <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Frank Sinatra,</a> <a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Diamond Platnumz</a></span>, and <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sammy Davis Jr</a></span>. without the help of a band, just a basic amplifier and a minidisc player filled with backup music.</p><p>Al Latta performed in beautiful glittery costumes every night and used the kitchen to change his many outfits. For Sinatra, he dons a black and gold jacket; for <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Neil Diamond</a></span>, a white jacket with blue and red sequins.</p><p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Al Latta’s temperament was, without a doubt, his capacity for adaptation. Al Latta connected closely with the audience by fusing humor, charisma, and natural skill.</p><p>The audience was amazed through his skills, Latta seamlessly transition from one part to the next while engaging in impromptu comedic sketches, singing, dancing, and acting.</p><p>His show builds gradually, during “Brown Eyed Girl,” he would spin quickly onstage by himself or locate a young woman to pull beside him.</p><p>He sings in a deep growl <strong>behind the beat</strong>, then rushes to finish each line. The <strong>Cigar Box</strong> audience and Lounge dearly missed ai Latta.</p><h2><strong>Tributes for AI Latta</strong></h2><p>Many of Latta’s friends and fans sent condolences to his family on social media. One of his beloved friends, <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Troy Moore</a></span><strong>, </strong>wrote with Latta’s photos on Facebook:</p><p></p><p>“Just found out my buddy Al has taken his final bow. So many fun memories at the Cigar Box. I will miss his crooner voice, kindness, willingness to let me sing EVERY time we walked in the bar…and his sparkly jackets. He called me the “Neil Diamond of Kansas City.” Rest in peace buddy.”</p><p>And <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Molly Kuplen</a></span> also posted a video and her pictures with Latta and stated:</p><p></p><p>“The end of an era. Rest in peace, Al. You brought al latta smiles to al latta people. Thanks for all the memories, you will be missed by many.”</p><p>Source: <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=#>uptospeedjournalism.com</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2SurXnLmqutmV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
