The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actor</a>, 39, was in full ’90s garb, wearing a pair of belted light blue jeans, a long-sleeve, patterned polo shirt, and a mullet. As it would happen, this isn’t the first time that fans have gotten a look at Seth on the set of the Hulu mini-series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/seth-rogen-mullet-on-set-pam-tommy-backgrid-enbed.jpg>In late April, Seth was spotted on set sporting <a href=#>his new mullet for the show</a>. The wardrobe and hair styling is quite a departure from Seth’s average look, and he posted a mirror selfie of his costume to the series’ official Instagram account on May 7, to give fans a clearer look. You can see that picture below. But the actor is taking on quite a fascinating challenge with this role. Seth is playing <strong>Rand Gauthier</strong>, an electrician who infamously stole a safe from&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Tommy Lee</strong></a>‘s home in the ’90s after he was fired by the rock star.<p id=content-paragraph-4>The safe happened to contain a video tape of Pamela and Tommy being intimate. The electrician then plotted to sell the tape, in a meticulous rouse chronicled by&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>,&nbsp;and the case become one of the most famous in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the ’90s couple’s history together</a>. Now that story is coming to life on Hulu, and Seth is doing much more than just taking on a starring role.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The actor is also executive producing the series, and he’s in great company with some all-star cast mates. Along with Seth, the mini-series stars MCU star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sebastian Stan</strong></a> as Tommy Lee and&nbsp;Downton Abbey alum <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lily James</strong></a> as Pamela Anderson. Since casting was announced, fans have been eager to see the actors’ transformations.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sebastian and Lily have each been spotted on set in full Pam and Tommy costume. More recently, Lily was even seen wearing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a blue velour tracksuit</a>, which the&nbsp;Baywatch alum often sported. As for Sebastian, the actor has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>totally emulated that rock star lifestyle</a> as the <strong>Mötley Crüe&nbsp;</strong>founding member. Although the series has yet to announce a release date, it is expected to start streaming on Hulu in 2021. With the cast and crew still in production, we cannot wait to see more snapshots from behind-the-scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49tZqydpJ16s7vGnqVmqJGieqK6w2arqKWdrnq0sdNmp6Kbo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
