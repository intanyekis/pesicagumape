Smith was mediocre against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=31 href=#>Cardinals</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=56 href=#>Chargers</a> — one favorable and one tough matchup — and now the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=57 href=#>Seahawks</a> face the Cardinals again. Smith is streamable, but he’s also a low-volume passer who needs 2+ touchdowns for QB1 value — similar to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XUAZZ3AjcOywkoZU href=#>Ryan Tannehill</a> in the past.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=cWsPQC7Rmam5Z0pU href=#>D’Andre Swift</a>, RB, DET</strong> <strong>🦆🦆 </strong>— It was Swift’s first game back, it was saved by a receiving touchdown, and it was a bit concerning. Swift didn’t look good between the tackles, as <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yiuEdPRfziuCcAfe href=#>Jamaal Williams</a> continues to impress. Even before his injury, Swift had just one game with more than seven rushes (Week 1) — Williams still had two rushing touchdowns and 11 carries in that contest. This remains a full-blown timeshare.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=HkEmvXwEObnc0Moq href=#>Michael Carter</a>, RB, NYJ</strong> <strong>🦆🦆🥚 </strong>— With <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0wRtgeNKRm1GJAfJ href=#>Breece Hall</a> done for 2022 and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=unROptTvWAZr04Fe href=#>James Robinson</a> not even with the team for a week, Carter had just 55.2% of the snaps, seven rushes (26 yards) and 7-4-35 receiving. Thankfully, he had 71.9% of the passing snaps, which was second-most this year, but it doesn’t appear Carter will see the boost we had hoped to see if the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=52 href=#>Jets</a> wouldn’t maximize his touches in Robinson’s first game. Carter is a lower-end RB2, and he could dip back into the RB3 range if Robinson shows any of his early-season juice.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=rZB1Zt6xVz0mDr2r href=#>Brian Robinson</a>, RB, WSH</strong> <strong>🦆🦆🦆🥚 </strong>— <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GpaHEPmu2uOEYLN3 href=#>Antonio Gibson</a> looks better than Robinson, who is primarily relegated to early-down/rushing work. Gibson could be best in a timeshare, similar to how <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MxmpR6nqQxBtdIRD href=#>Lamar Miller</a> was better with mid-teen touches versus a bellcow role, and since Robinson has returned, Gibson is RB20 and RB26 in FPPG.</li><li><strong>Courtland Sutton, WR, DEN</strong> <strong>🦆🦆🦆 </strong>— The split with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jy7PvJsPl57HQPF0 href=#>Jerry Jeudy</a> is near-even when they play together, but over the past three games, Sutton has bombed. Jeudy had his own terrible two-game stretch earlier this year, and while Sutton should rebound as Jeudy did, he’ll be more volatile and touchdown reliant than Jeudy.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=qZ3H42PDGITKnjdb href=#>George Pickens</a>, WR, PIT</strong> <strong>🦆🦆 </strong>— “<a class=ath_autolink data-id=stWwj88awWgSegzc href=#>Kenny Pickett</a> loves Pickens!” The truth is <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WlyUG8uLpZoIRjRJ href=#>Diontae Johnson</a> still leads in routes, targets and is barely behind Pickens in TmAirYD%, but Pickens has done more with his targets, glossing over the fact that this trio still carries plenty of risk. It’s a trio, and Pickett is still inconsistent, but Pickens does have a high ceiling as the wideout with the most No. 1 NFL receiver ability/makeup. — Now just one duck with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=v3fOOn0cVhJSuGmu href=#>Chase Claypool</a> traded to the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=36 href=#>Bears</a>. Just two main options (plus, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=eikKieC3POxasPA4 href=#>Pat Freiermuth</a>) for Pickett helps narrow the passing tree.</li></ul><p><strong>BYES: </strong>CLE, DAL, DEN, NYG, PIT, SF</p><h2><strong>STREAMING QUARTERBACK RANKINGS</strong></h2><p><strong>Top Streamers</strong></p><p><strong>If You’re Needy</strong></p><h2><strong>WAIVER WIRE RUNNING BACK RANKS</strong></h2><li><strong>Kenyan Drake, BAL </strong>— ONLY if <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jYLXYk8gk7wTcH29 href=#>Gus Edwards</a> is out. In that case, the Drake is back, and we like the Drake again… only because we have to. With no Edwards or <a class=ath_autolink data-id=L6EeYsywt7kR0LKG href=#>J.K. Dobbins</a>, Drake would be an RB2… albeit, rather risky. If Edwards is okay, Drake is down by <a class=ath_autolink data-id=IYn7GkEINqUslRyH href=#>Chuba Hubbard</a> or even lower.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=CT3M0JqfBUqnHKTr href=#>Khalil Herbert</a>, CHI</strong> — That’s two straight games with Herbert getting at least 13 touches with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NIQ0MLumUaekHlAa href=#>David Montgomery</a> healthy, and Week 8 came while his Snap% was just 29.6 compared to 41.4 in Week 7.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=FQl4SAM9LswbJquR href=#>Tyler Allgeier</a>, ATL </strong>— It was another week where <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1DpnHN5Di34YK8gV href=#>Caleb Huntley</a> had the better performance, but Allgeier split the lead, and most importantly, saw most of the passing game work. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=toxIJgWTQSZoqgUF href=#>Cordarrelle Patterson</a>’s return would make Allgeier a dicey option, but until then, Allgeier is an RB2/3 and could hold RB3 value after, given the Falcons’ offense.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=QKtau6d3Xq0Ju5fo href=#>Isiah Pacheco</a>, KC </strong>— We saw what the “new starter” role meant for Pacheco before the bye, and as of now, the backfield is a full-blown committee. There is a chance Pacheco sees more of a “true” starter role out of the bye, but until we see at least 50% of the snaps and work, Pacheco is a dicey RB3 with Top 15 potential.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=3EyWZhI8amd4XadO href=#>Rachaad White</a>, TB</strong> — White has been seeing more of the share, and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=VciphY1MTsYvKim0 href=#>Leonard Fournette</a> has been a bit mid this year. If Fournette misses time, White would be in the Top 15 conversation, and he’s an RB3 with weekly use.</li><li><strong>Chuba Hubbard, CAR </strong>— <a class=ath_autolink data-id=z8djv1zj7ZnuvLed href=#>D’Onta Foreman</a> is locked in as an RB2, but his 2nd/3rd-and-long and passing down use didn’t improve much without Hubbard, pointing to Hubbard getting some <a href=#>Nyheim Hines</a>-like work. That’s tough to start any given week, but deep leagues might be needy, and Hubbard would be a fringe RB2 if Foreman ever got hurt.</li><li><strong>Chase Edmonds and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=colhdJohkEl1euvz href=#>Latavius Murray</a>, DEN </strong>— With the Edmonds trade, this mess becomes even messier. Murray sees the early-downs and short yardage, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=iG0dcxnVAM298IG5 href=#>Melvin Gordon</a> now gets a few carries in that area and some passing game work, and Edmonds is the main pass-catcher and 2nd/3rd-and-long option. Overall, it’s hard to like any as more than a matchup-based RB3/fringe RB2 now.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=V9WsxIeYj24OGcsU href=#>Kyren Williams</a>, LAR </strong>— The backfield is a mess and the offensive line can’t block. Sean McVay praised Williams from Day 1, so he could be the majority share leader when healthy, but even then, the Rams’ situation could limit him to RB3 value.</li><li><strong>Jeff Wilson, MIA </strong>— Traded to the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=47 href=#>Dolphins</a> with Edmonds off to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=40 href=#>Denver</a>, Wilson remains a high-end backup, but one that might see a few more touches with the Dolphins than he did behind <a class=ath_autolink data-id=FSp2bTsEwxXRf1oa href=#>Christian McCaffrey</a>. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=U2DluzFgHJ8ncRvW href=#>Elijah Mitchell</a> is now back to being the high-end backup to CMC once back (soon) with a likely <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nXevDUR36Ygzc7T5 href=#>Tyrion Davis-Price</a> lead and timeshare with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=P7pb1hturRnejFF7 href=#>Jordan Mason</a> until then.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=pDjPhsEzJCJ0U3lz href=#>Deon Jackson</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=kAHZyHA4G8rn5Y8V href=#>Zack Moss</a>, IND </strong>— With Nyheim Hines gone, Jackson is back up to No. 2 behind <a class=ath_autolink data-id=mOJfkT1ezS1XnPyT href=#>Jonathan Taylor</a>, and we’ve seen him succeed with RB1 potential when Taylor (and Hines) were out. He’s next up and can absorb some of the lost Hines targets. The Moss piece likely means he will work in if Taylor is out (insurance piece), but there is a chance (albeit small) the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=44 href=#>Colts</a> see something… heck, the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=34 href=#>Bills</a> were fooled for a bit with Moss… and give him the No. 2 role with time. Jackson ranks here (and would be the top pickup if Taylor is out), and Moss is down at the bottom.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=J75IZX5jHlFuYFtA href=#>Jaylen Warren</a>, PIT </strong>— Also a top backup, Warren has looked better than <a class=ath_autolink data-id=F2LCCMIThT7glLVQ href=#>Najee Harris</a> several times, leading to questions of the Lisfranc injury bothering Harris and Warren getting more work.</li><li><strong>Nyheim Hines, BUF </strong>— Hines goes from a potential weekly RB3 in PPR to mixing in with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yynfZqHDAdhkOwK4 href=#>James Cook</a> behind <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9Ps1MFRXoDMzHOvl href=#>Devin Singletary</a>. This hurts the value of every running back, as the Bills are middle of the road in targeting running backs with Singletary monopolizing most. Singletary gets a slight ding, Hines drops and James Cook remains a “when have the lead” option to get more carries… with now near no passing game value. Singletary is a low-end RB2, Hines a risky PPR-reliant low-end RB3 and Cook a hope for a big Bills lead and backup plan if Singletary missed time.</li><li><strong>James Cook, BUF</strong> — As mentioned before their bye, the Bills could give Cook more work as he continues to develop, and he has continued to see more touches in games with a lead. That should happen plenty down the stretch given the Bills’ talent and schedule. However, the Nyheim Hines trade dings him a bit now (see below).</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=DHCsKLAJ2mLK9vIf href=#>Isaiah Spiller</a>, LAC</strong> — Spiller is a good talent with more upside than Sony Michel if given the opportunity to be the next one up with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=gFtzWAfyppY6QCgV href=#>Joshua Kelley</a> out and the Chargers off their bye week.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=jJGYtD0ofLApsx14 href=#>Jerick McKinnon</a>, KC </strong>— McKinnon has been the most consistent in passing game snaps giving him a low-ceiling/high-floor mix in the mid-low RB3 range — unless the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=46 href=#>Chiefs</a> whittle down to a two-man backfield with Pacheco and CEH.</li><li><strong>Sony Michel, LAC</strong> — Michel is the current next option behind <a class=ath_autolink data-id=dvB3Y1Q3OYzjd6Wm href=#>Austin Ekeler</a>, but given the skill comparison to Spiller, don’t be surprised to see him fall to being the third option, as he was behind Kelley.</li><h3><strong>BACKUPS and/or LONG-TERM UPSIDE STASH</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Khalil Herbert, CHI</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=kUzBxoSbOCrNzg5T href=#>Alexander Mattison</a>, MIN</strong></li><li><strong>James Robinson, NYJ</strong></li><li><strong>Elijah Mitchell, SF</strong></li><li><strong>Rachaad White, TB</strong></li><li><strong>Deon Jackson, IND</strong></li><li><strong>Jaylen Warren, PIT</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=km4OzXJQh7WmkDCf href=#>Samaje Perine</a>, CIN</strong></li><li><strong>Isaiah Spiller, LAC</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=FCgpJDRww5zwHjAU href=#>Zamir White</a>, LV</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=E1OdwmHmGa1DMOvb href=#>Dontrell Hilliard</a>, TEN</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=iHFMN3OVvpMotqo4 href=#>Matt Breida</a>, NYG</strong></li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=sF1L2C2z3uBK3Gd6 href=#>Snoop Conner</a>, JAX</strong></li></ul><h2><strong>WAIVER WIRE WIDE RECEIVER RANKS</strong></h2><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=MVKA2Tjc5jrKX2Eo href=#>Garrett Wilson</a>, NYJ </strong>— I was surprised to see Wilson under 50% rostered even with recent struggles, and particularly with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2CsE6KTEuJcH8fcU href=#>Corey Davis</a> sidelined. Yes, Davis returning could immediately wet-blanket the excitement, but until then — and in the off chance the Jets turn back to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0lQDEpnpDyZhA4BO href=#>Joe Flacco</a> — we should be rostering Wilson.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=fEjVcQTMlG9yZLDJ href=#>Rondale Moore</a>, ARI </strong>— Moore was quiet in Week 7 during DeAndre Hopkins’ return but came up huge in Week 8. Since Week 4, Moore has 18.6 TmTGT% and 33-24-251-1 receiving, firmly in the No. 2 role until <a class=ath_autolink data-id=rk7pCoYIRoCG5SgR href=#>Marquise Brown</a> returns.</li><li><strong>Josh Palmer, LAC </strong>— Mentioned last week. Palmer fits the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ML1CWh5B5qxLiF5o href=#>Mike Williams</a> role better than the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XGV9gVOFefUVWSHi href=#>Keenan Allen</a> one, so don’t be surprised to see Palmer hit that value we hoped to see when in the No. 2 role earlier this year.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=JCfT8xBjl9cnhfbM href=#>Wan’Dale Robinson</a>, NYG </strong>— Week 8 was Robinson’s worst game as a full-fledged starter, and this is the risk with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=51 href=#>Giants</a> offense and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=OeqLvbJNbGyXeJqu href=#>Daniel Jones</a>. Nevertheless, his elusiveness and trustworthiness for Jones and Brian Daboll make Robinson a weekly starter in most fantasy leagues.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=1i1VGcylKsLxlzZU href=#>Devin Duvernay</a>, BAL </strong>— With <a class=ath_autolink data-id=7r64wrPtMtfN7lWT href=#>Rashod Bateman</a> out again, Duvernay steps in, but his increase might not be as much as originally thought. Duvernay never topped 80.6 Route%, even when Bateman was out and only surpassed 18.8 TmTGT% once (25.9), which results in just 7-5-54-0.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=0ufRedGY8NfSuTZ4 href=#>Alec Pierce</a>, IND </strong>— It’s just one game, but Sam Ehlinger turned to Pierce, particularly downfield, more than <a class=ath_autolink data-id=K1VzBOpV7J1CIsuU href=#>Matt Ryan</a> had recently. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=SP4XAwFWem23iSYq href=#>Parris Campbell</a> ran more routes, but Pierce had 5-3-65 and accounted for 52.1% of the team’s Air Yards.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=BSKlIouLvUAvaGy7 href=#>Kadarius Toney</a>, KC </strong>— Upside stash that needs patience if you’re doing it. JuJu Smith-Schuster is the No. 1, and even that’s limited in an offense starting with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4wuXOfkjv6uJbT7O href=#>Travis Kelce</a> and involving several weapons. For TmTGT%, Kelce has 23.9, JJSS 19.1, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QZu3f1NNn1Im0ne7 href=#>Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a> 15.1, Mecole Hardman 10.0, running backs 16.0 and 15.9 for various others. Toney has play-breaking ability, but 18.0% of the targets looks to be his ceiling, and a floor hovering in the 10% range is plausible given this offense. Toney has WR3 upside but may take a few games to get his role at full peak, and the risk is Toney is droppable by Week 12.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=7INPz2pLmnxnHIcr href=#>Darius Slayton</a>, NYG </strong>— Slayton has at least 19.4 TmTGT% in three of the past four games, finishing 7-6-79, 6-3-58-1 and 6-5-66, respectively, in those. Slayton has WR4 value, particularly during the byes, which the Giants are on now (if you search by projected points this week, you won’t find him).</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=q0QPlrY9858wcFnP href=#>Jahan Dotson</a>, WSH </strong>— Close to a return, and we’ve seen Taylor Heinicke improve <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2JTESgE97iUGOxVD href=#>Terry McLaurin</a>’s value and take more shots, so don’t be surprised if Dotson returns with WR4 value, albeit touchdown reliant.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=UqFugSbhHT7kqnvR href=#>Treylon Burks</a>, TEN </strong>— The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=61 href=#>Titans</a> passing game is weak, especially if <a class=ath_autolink data-id=SwMtBEALZsNIlnxh href=#>Malik Willis</a> is under center, but with Ryan Tannehill, Burks has WR3 value with touchdown upside for more when he returns.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=D5LN8pI6wfsQ6j64 href=#>Demarcus Robinson</a>, BAL </strong>— Robinson had his first good game of the season, and with Bateman hurt early, he had 23.5 TmTGT% and 21.3% of the Ravens Air Yards, finishing with 8-6-64-0. Duvernay is the safer bet, but Robinson has a higher ceiling with the associated risk of giving you a zero.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=9fa2VsIKUBzVGgsI href=#>Mack Hollins</a>, LV </strong>— Hollins has been the new No. 2 — in value — for the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=53 href=#>Raiders</a> this year.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=NywqdtuDESIKN3FH href=#>KJ Hamler</a>, DEN</strong> — If someone ponies up for Jerry Jeudy, Hamler would be the No. 2 in Denver, though, that’s still extremely volatile and hard to trust even in trying to predict favorable matchups. Hamler moves to the bottom without a Jeudy trade.</li><li><strong>Parris Campbell, IND </strong>— As mentioned, Ehlinger wasn’t overly interested in the short game for his first start. He’s still a quality quarterback in that area, so better weeks could be in store for Campbell, but the tide has shifted back to Pierce for now.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=9h0WEZukRMXPyeiT href=#>Donovan Peoples-Jones</a>, CLE </strong>— On a bye, but DPJ is strangely much better than <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8skQnSg23GLuojrg href=#>Amari Cooper</a> on the road, and the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=38 href=#>Browns</a> head to Miami out of their bye.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=VZVfuKVVwsmIJEzg href=#>Van Jefferson</a>, LAR </strong>— No targets in his first game back, but Jefferson proved valuable last year, even as the No. 3, and there is a chance <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GVPoK13XWqyWuFir href=#>Cooper Kupp</a> could miss a game or two.</li><li><strong>Terrace Marshall, CAR </strong>— In the past two weeks, Marshall has 96.7 Route%, 21.1 TmTGT% and 24.1 TmAirYD%. Week 8 showed his upside with a decent amount of targets, but even though Marshall has Top 30 upside, the floor is extremely low in this offense.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=1EtoVjae5J7NlEFl href=#>Tyquan Thornton</a>, NE </strong>— The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=49 href=#>Patriots</a> receivers are banged up, and as the second option behind <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WnLx6ILnpqUFSWlV href=#>Jakobi Meyers</a>, Thornton can be a deep-league WR4.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=CjkT770tGG6SezgO href=#>DeAndre Carter</a>, LAC </strong>— More in the Allen role, Carter will spend time in the slot and is the No. 3, but he does have big-play ability.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=R4vCR39OY86BLjdH href=#>N’Keal Harry</a>, CHI </strong>— Harry didn’t see a route or snap uptick, but he found the end zone in Week 8. Harry is no more than a deep-league dart throw in case he moves to the No. 2 spot with 80%+ of the snaps, and even then, he’d be a mere WR4.</li><h3><strong>MEH </strong>😒<strong> NO THANKS</strong></h3><ul><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZYruAbblOnFDNrCS href=#>Samori Toure</a>, GB</strong> — Even with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=e1FPMonfjkFEZUw2 href=#>Christian Watson</a> concussed and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=6kRYgRiHQC268ZHV href=#>Sammy Watkins</a> banged up again, Toure ran just 42.4% of the routes. Toure would need <a class=ath_autolink data-id=eGiVBnU1v4yPJ8oV href=#>Allen Lazard</a> to remain sidelined with Watson and Watkins out to be worthy of a WR4 start.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=tNU6MGonw4SVDRAu href=#>Damiere Byrd</a>, ATL</strong> — Okay, back-to-back weeks, but the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=32 href=#>Falcons</a> still barely pass, and Byrd didn’t even reach 60% of routes. I’ll take the chance Byrd doesn’t have three straight games with a big touchdown.</li></ul><h3><strong>UNBREAK MY HEART</strong></h3><ul><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=KWxtPO2MBzNEMVsz href=#>Romeo Doubs</a>, GB ❤️❤️❤️&nbsp;</strong>— Look, if all the other <a class=ath_autolink data-id=42 href=#>Packers</a> are going to fall apart, the volume is undeniable. Even if Lazard returns, Doubs is set as the No. 2 until everyone is healthy. He would rank at the top if everyone is hurt but he and Toure. If Lazard is back but the rest are out still, Doubs checks in ahead of Wan’Dale Robinson.</li><li><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=odZ9yg3RbLFHzE67 href=#>Darnell Mooney</a>, CHI ❤️❤️❤️❤️ </strong>— Mooney was already here, but somehow, he’s still under 60%.
