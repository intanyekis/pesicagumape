Known for her alluring roles in <i>Basic Instinct, Casino, Bobby, The Mighty, </i>and <i>The Muse</i>, Stone's sex symbol image remain etched in a legion of fans' memories. &nbsp;</p><p>Although heavily defined by her slew of erotic roles and media portrayal, Stone has time and again unveiled her true self behind her onscreen life and mass perception of her. Aged 65 now, the Pennsylvania-born actress is a two-time married woman and a doting mother of three. &nbsp;</p><h2>Sharon Stone's First Failed Marriage! &nbsp;</h2><p>The<i> Basic Instinct</i> fame has had many high-profile relationships, flings, and heartbreaks over the years. Her earliest romantic link was with television producer <strong>Michael Greenburg</strong>, who would become her first husband. Stone's failed marriage with Greenburg. However, Greenburg wasn't her first heartbreak. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/25/338972834_895307401763116_5420100206050495696_n%20(1)%20(1)-1685031206227.jpg><p>The Golden Globe winner had a whole other life before she found fame; Stone suffered chaotic years in poverty, horrific abuse at the hands of her father, and even got pregnant by her first serious boyfriend. In her memoir, <i>The Beauty of Living Twice</i>, the actress recalls the heartbreaking incident when she traveled to Ohio for an abortion. &nbsp;</p><p>Stone's first notable romance as she started living her second life, endowed to her by fame, was Greenburg. The duo met on the sets of <i>The Vegas Strip War,</i> in 1984, and started dating shortly after. Smitten and infatuated in their budding romance, Sharon and Greenburg tied the knot hastily the same year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/25/326665146_1852861448382047_3672231929553747866_n%20(1)%20(1)-1685031213091.jpg><p>The couple's whirlwind marriage took place on August 18, 1984, on the set of the same movie, and in their coming few years as spouses, they worked together in the 1986 adventure comedy, <i>Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold. &nbsp;</i></p><p>Troubled knocked on the duo's paradise around the same time, and although not much was said, Stone and Greenburg announced their separation a year later in 1997. The Basic Instinct actress and her then-husband settled their divorce privately in 1990. &nbsp;</p><h2>Sharon Stone's Second Marriage was Unfortunate! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>In the years following her divorce, Sharon dated many eligible bachelors, including producer <strong>Steve Bing</strong>, singer <strong>Dwight Yoakam</strong>, and producer<strong> Bill Macdonald</strong>, but only took the second leap into marriage with journalist <strong>Phil Bronstein</strong>. Stone married the Pulitzer Prize finalist on February 14, 1998. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/25/335986183_1437394590132665_1933215722421091832_n%20(1)%20(1)-1685031228026.jpg><p>During their six-year-long nuptial, Stone underwent some unimaginable pain. The actress's perpetual health issues and an autoimmune disease obstructed her capability to become a mother, resulting in several miscarriages. Stone and her then-husband eventually resorted to adoption, and welcomed their son, <strong>Roan Joseph Bronstein</strong>, in 2000. &nbsp;</p><p>Three years after that altruistic milestone, Bronstein filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences." While looking back at her second divorce, Sharon said she saw it coming. "He just didn't see me, talk to me, looks at me," the <i>Basic Instinct</i> actress said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/25/338783549_1238908080332356_5115990738082191915_n%20(1)%20(1)-1685031239588.jpg><p>Expressing her disappointment over the second failed marriage, Stone alluded to Bronstein's corrupted intention from the beginning. "I was suckered. I'm embarrassed to say that," Stone added. Like the divorce wasn't painful enough, Stone experienced another blow when the court granted the custody of her son to Bronstein. &nbsp;</p><p>While Phil gained full custody, Sharon was only given a monthly visitation right. Stone <a href=# rel=nofollow>unveiled</a> the sexism and regressive judicial approach that cost her custody during her latest appearance on Bruce Bozzi's Table for Two podcasts. The judge asked my child, my tiny little boy, 'Do you know your mother makes sex movies?'" Stone recalled. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Sharon Stone is a Mother of Three! &nbsp;</h2><p>Despite her repeated attempts, Stone was never able to conceive a child of her own. But for the Emmy-winning actress, there was no greater joy than parenting. After welcoming her son Roan with Bronstein, Sharon went on to adopt two more sons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/25/320202308_457737509678991_7467739327410424124_n%20(1)%20(1)-1685031251546.jpg><p>The actress's oldest, Roan, turned 23 recently. Except for the one time when Roan was wedged between his parents' contentious legal battle, he has pretty much remained away from the spotlight. But even after the court's harsh shot to estrange a young Roan away from his mother, he has kept an ideal mother-son relationship with Stone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Roan is an aspiring actor and model. His younger sibling, <strong>Laird Vonne Stone,</strong> was welcomed to the Stone family in May 2005. Laird has made a few red carpet-appearances with his famous mother. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sharon Stone reveals the real reason she lost custody of her son!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The <i>Total Recall</i> actress adopted her youngest, <strong>Quinn Kelly Stone,</strong> in June 2006. Quinn has reportedly taken an interest in sports and plays as a quarterback on his school's team. Sharon shockingly revealed that she lost nine babies in miscarriages.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfolding the magnitude of loss and heartbreak, Stone reflected on the hardship she faced.&nbsp;</p><p>"It is no small thing, physically nor emotionally yet we are made to feel it is something to bear alone," the actress <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnq0tMCrpqdlo6m8r7HSZquupaWhwba71KxkqZ2iqLyvrctmo6KelQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
