She grew up in a family with close ties to the movie business. Her father, Caleb Deschanel, is a cinematographer and director, and her mother, Mary Jo Deschanel, is an actress. Emily and her younger sister, Zooey Deschanel, were raised in a Roman Catholic family.</p><p>Emily went to high school in Los Angeles before going to college at Boston University. During her college years, she took part in a programme for professional actors and got a Bachelor of Fine Arts in theatre.</p><h2><strong>Emily Deschanel: Career</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Emily’s first major role was in the 1994 movie “It Could Happen to You,” where she was a member of the cast. On that project, her father was in charge of making movies. After that, she had a part in the miniseries “Rose Red,” and then she was in movies like “Cold Mountain,” “The Alamo,” and “Glory Road.” By 2004, many people said she was one of the most talented young actresses of her time.</p><p style=color:#252525>In 2005, she was cast as Dr. Temperance Brennan, the main character on the Fox comedy-drama “Bones.” The show is based on forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs’s real-life work. “Bones” was a big hit, and it ran for 12 seasons before it finally ended in 2017. Deschanel was given a number of awards, such as a nomination for a Satellite Award in 2005 and a nomination for a Teen Choice Award in 2007.</p><p style=color:#252525>Emily started working as a co-producer at the start of the third season of “Bones,” in addition to her acting role. By the fourth season, both she and her co-star David Boreanaz had become full-fledged producers. She played the same character again in an episode of “Sleepy Hollow” and gave her character’s voice in the animated series “Bojack Horseman.” In recent years, Deschanel may be best known for her role on the TV show “Animal Kingdom,” which she has played more than once.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Emily-Deschanel.jpg alt="Emily Deschanel" width=500 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Emily Deschanel: Bones Salary</strong></h2><p>Emily and her co-star David Boreanaz both made $250,000 per episode of Bones when the show was at its most popular. The show ran for several seasons before it was cancelled. That came to about $5 million per season for each show. When the series was first sold to syndication, they both made a lot of money. But, as we’ll explain in a minute, Emily and a few other people eventually felt they weren’t being paid fairly…</p><h2><strong>Emily Deschanel: </strong><strong>Bones Lawsuit</strong></h2><p>Emily, a few of her co-stars, the show’s executive producer Barry Josephson, and Kathy Reichs all sued Fox in 2015. They said that the network was “cheating” them out of their fair share of the profits, and they were initially given $179 million in damages. But this settlement was thrown out. Later in 2019, both sides reached a deal, and the plaintiffs got a “significant” settlement.</p><h2><strong>Emily Deschanel: Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Deschanel married actor and writer David Hornsby in 2010. He is best known for his work on the show “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” In 2011, they were happy to meet their first child. She had her second child with Hornsby in 2015.</p><h2><strong>Emily Deschanel: Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Emily and Zooey used to own a 1920s duplex together in the Hancock Park neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The Spanish-style house was bought by the Sisters for $1.4 million in 2011.</p><h2><strong>Emily Deschanel Net Worth In 2023</strong></h2><p>Emily Deschanel is an American actress, TV producer, and movie maker with a $30 million net worth. Emily may be best known for her role as Dr. Temperance “Bones” Brennan in the popular Fox show “Bones.” This show ended in 2017 after 12 seasons and 246 episodes. Emily is the older sister of actress Zooey Deschanel.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li class=entry-title><a href=# rel=bookmark>Trump Net Worth 2022: How Rich Is Former President Donald Trump? | The Current</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5q6qrjYZpueq5Odrq%2Bxy2alnqxdrLyzwMdoaW9vY2p8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
