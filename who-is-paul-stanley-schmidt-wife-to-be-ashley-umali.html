Ashley Umali, Paul’s fiancee, and his three-year-old daughter, Erica, witnessed the horrifying tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>Umali stood there helpless while her fiancee was spending his final moments drenched in blood and lying lifelessly on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>Her agony and devastation reached a new height when people gathered around the crime scene just to film it.&nbsp;</p><p>No one stepped forward to lend a hand to the dying man. Those ruthless individuals kept on filming the graphic scene and then posted the disturbing video online.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul lost his life while trying to protect his daughter from the harmful effects of vape smoke.</p><p>According to his mother, the altercation between Paul and the stranger began when he asked him to stop smoking vape in front of her daughter’s stroller.&nbsp;</p><p>The stranger, who most probably was not in his senses, stabbed Paul after a brief verbal argument.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, Paul succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>The video featuring Paul’s brutal murder, titled ‘Canada dad stabbed at Starbucks Reddit video’ has gone viral on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>It is mind-boggling to see how many stone-cold people seek pleasure from seeing such disturbing content.&nbsp;</p><p>The video also reached Paul’s <a href=#>family</a>, who are going through unimaginable pain and suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>The victim’s mother, Kathy, has requested people to stop sharing the disturbing video as it is causing them an unthinkable amount of distress.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost four days after the gruesome tragedy, the authorities have identified Paul’s attacker. Inderdeep Singh Gosa was the man who fatally stabbed Paul due to an insignificant reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Gosa has been charged with second-degree murder, but the victim’s family is pushing for the charge to be upgraded to first-degree murder, citing proof of premeditation.</p><p>Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim called the attack a senseless act, and Starbucks Canada offered support to its employees who were eyewitnesses to the attack.</p><p>Umali and Erica have been traumatized after the attack on Paul, and it will take a lot of time for them to heal from this unimaginable trauma. Kathy has requested everyone to send prayers for their small family.&nbsp;</p><p>The victim’s mother said Umali had been shattered by the loss.</p><p><strong>“She’s not talking a lot, and I’m on my way to see her now so I can actually have a conversation with her face-to-face. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to have her tell me the whole story, and maybe she can’t, I don’t know,” </strong>she told a <a href=#>news</a> outlet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“It was pretty horrific for her to stand and watch the whole thing unfold with her baby,” </strong>Schmidt added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did Gosa stab Paul?</h2><p>Paul’s mother, Kathy, revealed that the argument between her son and Gosa started when the attacker started vaping right in front of Paul’s daughter, Erica.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul asked Gosa not to vape since the smoke from vaping is detrimental to a toddler’s health.&nbsp;The argument escalated out of limits in the blink of an eye, and Gosa, out of nowhere, stabbed Paul.&nbsp;</p><p>The victim’s family said that Paul’s murder was premeditated, but the authorities have yet to make a comment on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people have assumed that Gosa may be going through some mental health issues, which is why he took such a drastic step without thinking twice.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdpa62uIysq5qmnJrGbr%2FCoaSinKRixKqyxGarqGWSmnqiv8elnLJlpaKurbWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
