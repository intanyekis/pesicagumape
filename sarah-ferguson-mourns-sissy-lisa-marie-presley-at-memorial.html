My late mother-in-law [<a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, who <a href=#>died in September 2022</a>] used to say that ‘Nothing [that] can be said can begin to take away the anguish and the pain of these moments because grief is the price we pay for love.’ And <a href=#>how right she was</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sarah-Ferguson-Mourns-Sissy-Lisa-Marie-Presley-at-Graceland-Memorial-Feature.jpg><p class=p3>Ferguson — who first met the Tennessee native when she and ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Michael Lockwood</strong></a> lived in England — went on to <a href=#>pay her respects to Lisa Marie’s loved ones</a> in her eulogy.</p><p class=p1>“We look at <a href=#><strong>Priscilla [Presley]</strong> </a>as a mother to Lisa Marie, we look at Lisa Marie and say, ‘You lost a son,’” she said on Sunday, referring to <a href=#>Benjamin Keough</a>, who died by suicide in 2020. “Mothers losing children — there are no words for it. So <a href=#>today we talk about action</a>. Action is the way we can go forward, we can light the flame. So for Riley, for Harper and Finley and the entire family, we march forward in support of you. All of us are with you. If you just put out your hand, we will be there. I will definitely be there.”</p><p class=p1>The “Storm & Grace” singer <a href=#>died on January 12 at the age of 54</a> after suffering cardiac arrest.
