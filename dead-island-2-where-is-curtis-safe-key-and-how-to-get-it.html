The game features various side quests that reward the player with loot, weapons, and money. One of these side quests is called Death of the Party, where the player has to help a former movie star named Curtis Sinclair to clear out his mansion from the undead invaders. During this quest, the player will find a locked safe in Curtis’ wine storage room, which contains some valuable items. However, the key to the safe is not found in the mansion, but in the hands of a special zombie outside. This article will explain where to find Curtis’ safe key in Dead Island 2 and how to get it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Finding the Safe</h2><p>The safe is located in the wine storage room, near the rear entrance by the staff restrooms and opposite the utility room by the garage side door. The safe is marked as Curtis’ Valuables Safe and requires a specific key to open it. The key is not found in the mansion, but in the rear area outside, where there is a giant monogrammed crest on the ground.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Finding the Key</h2><p>The key is held by a zombie named Crystal the Lawyer, who is a Screamer type of enemy. Screamers are zombies that can emit a loud and piercing shriek that can stun and damage the player. They also have a high resistance to damage and can dodge attacks easily. To find Crystal the Lawyer, the player has to go to the rear area of the mansion, which should be marked as a Screamer Hot Spot on the map. If the area is not marked, the player has to progress further in the story until it is.</p><p>Crystal the Lawyer can spawn randomly in the rear area, along with other Screamers and zombies. The player has to look for her and target her to see her name. The best way to deal with Screamers is to use ranged weapons, such as guns or throwing knives, and aim for their heads. Alternatively, the player can use a curveball, which is a special ability that allows the player to throw a weapon in a curved trajectory, to interrupt their shriek and get close to them. The player can also block their shriek by holding the block button, which will reduce the stun and damage effect.</p><p>Once Crystal the Lawyer is killed, she will drop Curtis’ safe key, which the player can pick up and use to open the safe in the wine storage room. The safe contains a Tactical Heavy Revolver, which is a powerful handgun, and some cash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Curtis’ safe key is a hidden side quest in Dead Island 2 that requires the player to help a former movie star in his mansion and then kill a special zombie outside. The key rewards the player with a revolver and some money, which can be useful in the game. The key is not easy to find, as it involves fighting a Screamer enemy, which is one of the most dangerous types of zombies in the game. The player has to use ranged weapons, curveballs, or blocking to deal with them effectively. Curtis’ safe key is one of the many secrets and challenges that Dead Island 2 offers to the players who explore its zombie-infested world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmbKisIyiqqWZnpl6c3nWoZyrnV2ewG6v1KuroqtdqK6nsYyknLJlkaOxbrTOsGStp12csrV5yK1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
