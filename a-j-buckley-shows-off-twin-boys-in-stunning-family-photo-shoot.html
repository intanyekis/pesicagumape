Buckley</strong> was terrified when his twin boys arrived seven weeks early on Monday, March 5. But two months later, the 41-year-old dad says that Bodhi and Ranger are thriving and “turning into little chunks.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The fraternal twins couldn’t be any more different. “Bodhi is super chill and takes,&nbsp;like, 40 minutes to finish his bottle and falls asleep and doesn’t really cry,” revealed the CSI: NY alum. Ranger, meanwhile, “chugs” his milk. “When he’s awake, he’s like, ‘Rah!’ Buckley said. “Ranger is ready to go. He’s ready to jump out of the crib. Bodhi is cool with just sleeping.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/aj-buckley-abigail-ochse-willow-bodhi-ranger-inline-zoom.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>To celebrate how far the brothers have come since their three-week stint in the NICU, Buckley and his wife, <strong>Abigail Ochse,</strong> commissioned <a href=#>Kate Haus</a> to photograph the family at their Manhattan Beach, California, home&nbsp;on April 27. The shoot date has significant meaning: It’s the day Bodhi and Ranger were due — and Buckley’s late father’s birthday.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In one sweet snap, Buckley and <a href=#>The Chic Mamas</a> founder each hold a baby, while big sister Willow, 4, smiles for the camera. Buckley says Willow has adjusted to sharing her parents.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I think at first she was like, ‘What is this?’ She was confused, but she’s been awesome,” he raved to Us. “Each night she comes in and gives them hugs and kisses goodnight. It’s good.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In another picture, Buckley, who cofounded diaper bag company <a href=#>Paperclip</a>, shows off two of his designs. (He has a model named after each of his children!)</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While Ranger and Bodhi are a bit young for set visits, Willow is a regular at the CBS military drama.&nbsp;And she also has a special connection with cast member&nbsp;<a href=#><b>David Boreanaz</b>.</a> ”Uncle David has gotten his daughter a horse, so every time he talks to Willow he’s like, ‘Hey, daddy has gotta get you a horse!’ and I’m like, ‘Please stop,’”Buckley told Us. His solution was to get Willow a Fisher-Price model. “I’m like, ‘Here’s your horse.’ But every time we FaceTime from set, David’s like, ‘Hey, when’s your daddy gonna get you a horse.’”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>SEAL Team airs on CBS on Wednesdays at 9 p.m.</span></p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaaZZpir7avyqWcsmWjnby4v4yonZ9lpKy2r3nBqLCsZZmjerTA1KeloqaXYrOiucilsGaomKTBsHnSoaaorF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
