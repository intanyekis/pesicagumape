The actress and her character, Lady Sif, has since only appeared in Loki, in a cameo lasting seconds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Lady Sif has her own loyal following because of her appearance in the Thor comics, and her first appearance back in 2013 greatly excited fans about her role in the <a href=# rel=follow>MCU</a>. However, aside from these two cameos, she has appeared nowhere else until now.</p><p>In <a href=# rel=follow>Thor: Love and Thunder</a>, Lady Sif makes another appearance. However, is her character's screen time and the role big enough to justify an appearance at all? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Warning: Spoilers Ahoy!</p><h2>Jaimie Alexander’s Appearance on ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’</h2><p>If you haven't yet watched the movie, you shouldn't read further. However, if you have, you would know that Thor: Love and Thunder is getting lambasted everywhere for not taking itself too seriously and being too much of a comedy.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Further, it has also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">been criticized</a> for not justifying a few characters, the most prominent being&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Christian Bale</a>'s Gorr the God Butcher and Alexander's Lady Sif. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While <a href=# rel=follow>Taika Waititi</a>'s approach to this movie would make a whole another article, how he and the movie handle Lady Sif seems to be nothing more than fan service. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Jaimie Alexander, who plays Lady Sif, at the premiere of 'Thor: Love and Thunder' in June 2022.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Before the movie came out, people had <a href=# rel="follow noopener">varying speculations</a> about Lady Sif. Some suspected she could have been kidnapped or even sent on a secret mission.</p><p>And, after failing to win Thor's heart in the previous movies, many also thought she could be introduced as <a href=# rel=follow>Tessa Thompson</a>'s Valkyrie's new love interest.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, everyone thinking either of these would happen was&nbsp;utterly disappointed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lady Sif first appears in the movie on a distress video message where she is asking Thor to help her. Thor (played by <a href=# rel=follow>Chris Hemsworth</a>), along with Waititi's Korg, obliges and finds her missing an arm on the battlefield. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There, she reveals how she was left there to die so she could go to Valhalla — a fake notion — as Thor explains to her she would only go to Valhalla if she died during a battle. So, instead, Lady Sif, dressed in her comic-accurate costume, ends up in New Asgard, where she is treated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And that's where she remains until the end of the movie.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>All this plays out within a minute or two. So, Lady Sif is nowhere near a big part of the story and neither is Alexander a big cast member if we go solely by screen time distribution.</p><h2>Could Jaimie Alexander Be a Big Part of Upcoming ‘Thor’ Movies?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Towards the end of the movie, a one-handed warrior is shown training another character. This scene keeps a bit of the fans' hopes up regarding Lady Sif's (and Alexander's) future in the franchise.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Even though her appearance in Thor: Love and Thunder is nowhere near enough to justify her character, the franchise could still make up to Alexander and Lady Sif by making them a bigger or more crucial part of the upcoming Thor movies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition, few speculate the character the one-armed warrior is training could also become a major addition to the upcoming movie(s). Or perhaps she will make appearances worth more than cameos on Loki's returning season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRnrqqsYyao56wkaOxpr6MrZ%2Boql2hvLexjJqlnWWkncKvsMSrZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
