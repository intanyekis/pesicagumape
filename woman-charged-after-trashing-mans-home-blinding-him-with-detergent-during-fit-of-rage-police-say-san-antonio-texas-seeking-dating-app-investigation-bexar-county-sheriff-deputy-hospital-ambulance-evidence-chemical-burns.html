This app is known for being a sugar daddy hookup site.</p><p><a href=# title=https://www.seeking.com/how-it-works class=themeColorForLinks>The app's website </a>notes that "if you want to date the most beautiful women in the world, you need to bring more to the table than mere financial assets. Similarly, to connect with wealthy gentlemen, you need to hold yourself to a higher standard to create the lifestyle you want."</p><p>The man said nothing unusual happened during dinner, but he didn't intend to meet up again, but they continued texting each other.<br></p><p>The man then told police that Medina showed up around 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday unannounced, but he decided to let her in. They began to talk and drink some wine when, out of the blue, he said Medina asked him for $2,000. He told her he didn't have that kind of money.</p><p>He said Medina became enraged and began destroying a mounted flat screen TV, his custom entertainment center, as well as a painting, and then damaged several walls during her fit of rage.</p><p>According to the arrest report, Medina then poured laundry detergent on the man's head, getting the chemical solution in his eyes, causing burns and blinding him.</p><p>Police said she also stole several items, including an Apple Pro Max iPhone, a surveillance camera, a Dyson hair dryer, among other things, before taking off.</p><p>Blinded, the man crawled outside his home and began to yell for help. After Bexar County Sheriff's deputies arrived, the man was taken to the hospital with chemical burns to his eyes and cuts on his legs.</p><p>Medina is being held in the Bexar County Jail on $20,000 bond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmp5mknryvedaoqaWcX6y8rq3NZpqhmaKcsqV5wJ%2Brnqpdqb%2Biv8eipaBlnZa7tHnHqKSeZZKhtq%2BwyKeeZqCZonq4tdOhZJ2dpJq%2FqLHNrWSdraKeu6h5xaKrZqeWYr%2Bis8Rmp6ikmZiybr%2FAsmSsmZ5irq%2FAzqegqGWkmsWiv4ysnJ6jmaO0brDAraCnn12WvbF5yKetnquknrSiwMiopWaala2us3nCqKynrKliwKmx0aKdn2WUmr22wNhmn6iroJ7BoriMmqSbrZyWu6SxjJ6topyVo7CmecKhnKahk5a5bq7Uq6Ws</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
