Based on the novel by Liane Moriarty, Big Little Lies follows a group of women whose lives seem perfect on the surface.&nbsp;It's only once you dig a&nbsp;little deeper that things get darkâ€”and fast.</p><p>Big Little Lies&nbsp;started off as a miniseries, but its popularity warranted HBO to renew it for a second season. This is due, in part, to the all-star cast HBO hired to bring the world Moriarty created to the big screen.
