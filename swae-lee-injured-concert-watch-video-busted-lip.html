While opening for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Wiz Khalifa</strong></a>, 30,with his group <strong>Rae Sremmurd</strong>, in Dallas, the rapper was knocked right in his mouth so hard that he began gushing blood! With a busted lip and crimson stained face, the ‚ÄúBlack Beatles‚Äù rapper was fuming. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sue your a**‚Äù he says in a fan-taken video of the incident.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Whoever threw the item was probably having some regrets after seeing Swae‚Äôs reaction. He was FURIOUS. While it‚Äôs unclear what exactly the object was, it was evidently heavy enough to do some serious damage. ‚ÄúWhy are you throwing S**t on the stage man? Why you throwing some like a motherf**ing baseball bat?‚Äù Swae asked the crowd.&nbsp; At one point, Swae even tried to publicly out the offender, as he pulled their ID from the wallet they had tossed onstage, and read their name aloud.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Afraid of the situation escalating even more, Swae‚Äôs bandmates tried to calm him down, and carry him away, but Swae was NOT having it. ‚ÄúZoom in on my face!‚Äù he demanded the concert‚Äôs video team, as he continued his rant. A close-up look at the rapper‚Äôs injuries were horrific, and his entire chin was dripping blood. We can‚Äôt blame the rapper for being so livid. He later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared</a>&nbsp;on Twitter that the accident caused him to lose a tooth, AND required stitches.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>*NSFW* üò≥<br>Fan wanted a selfie and threw her cell phone at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@swaelee</a> ‚Ä¶here‚Äôs the result!
