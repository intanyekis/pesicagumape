During the interview, the West Coast icon was asked if he has felt a shift in the Black community as rappers and <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234805590>celebrities have endorsed Trump</a> over the years. In response, the multi-hyphenate artist said he believes it’s a “personal decision” who people vote for.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You know, people gonna make a decision on who they want to be president,” he began. “You know, I think it’s a personal decision. I don’t&nbsp;know if they care if any rappers or&nbsp;entertainers get up there and say anything. It’s really a personal decision.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking to the mixed reviews that both Trump and Biden have received during their respective terms, he added, “People know who Trump is. People know who Biden is. They gon’ make their decision no matter who gets up there and pushes whatever decision they on. The country knows both of these guys very well. I just think it’s gonna come down to a personal decision.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This year’s&nbsp;presidential election&nbsp;takes place on Nov. 5, with Trump running for the Republican Party and Biden continuing his work as the declared Democratic candidate.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since Trump’s 2016 election and double-impeachment in 2019 and 2021, he’s continued to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234855179>wiggle his way into Hip-Hop</a> for support. Kanye West backed Trump, to mix reactions, ultimately becoming one of his biggest allies. He also proudly rocked Trump’s infamous “Make America Great Again” hat. Trump also tried to appeal to rappers and the Black community when <a href=# data-type=post data-id=686145>he pardoned Lil Wayne,</a> and commutated Kodak Black’s prison sentence. He even credited himself for freeing A$AP Rocky from a Switzerland jail, which the rapper has debunked.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Others who have publicly shown support for the 77-year-old are <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234798292>Sexyy Red</a>, Chief Keef, Waka Flocka Flame, Azealia Banks, and more. Additionally, Ice Cube was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=684422>accused of being a Trump supporter</a> in 2020 after meeting with the former POTUS to discuss the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Contract With Black America</a>&nbsp;program to ensure the benefit the Black community.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the time Cube clarified that he hadn’t backed anyone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After receiving backlash online, the 54-year-old participated in a Clubhouse conversation with Big Tigger, where he further explained his reasoning for meeting with the Republican Party.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“To me, they the same people, one of them is just more polished than the other,” he spoke of both Biden and Trump. “They both White men from the 50s.” He then explained how the $500 billion dollars that have been promised to the Black community by Republicans outweighs the $150 billion offered by Democrats.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“They’re two sides of the same coin,” he added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX56wpnnCrpmeZZSksrS602aroaGeoHqkscuemauhpK56prrDqKmsnZ2au7W%2FjKKln6SlmruksYyvpq2do2J%2Bc3%2BTcW5ya2BtfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
