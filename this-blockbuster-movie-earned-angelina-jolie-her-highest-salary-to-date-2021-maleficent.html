To nobody’s surprise, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the flick was a massive success</a>, earning $758 million worldwide and subsequently getting the thumbs up for a sequel in just weeks after the first movie’s release.</p><p>What was most interesting, however, was the amount of money Jolie was said to have earned for signing on for the movie — and how much did she make for agreeing to star in a follow-up five years later? Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-s-angelina-jolie-s-highest-paying-film>What’s Angelina Jolie’s Highest-Paying Film?</h2><p>For 2012’s Maleficent, Jolie earned a whopping $33 million, which became her highest-paying salary for a single movie at the time.</p><p>But she wasn’t just getting paid to star in the fantasy flick, she had also been awarded producer credits — it’s unclear what exactly the latter role entailed for the actress, but it’s sure to have increased her overall pay after all was said and done.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Angelina Jolie’s Relationship With The Weeknd</a></span></p><p>Because she was filming Maleficent, Jolie had turned down the opportunity of starring opposite George Clooney in 2013’s Gravity; a role which was later passed down to Sandra Bullock, who went on to make an eye-watering $70 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sum was so high because she negotiated a deal that saw her earn around 13% of the backend profits the film made, with its final box office numbers standing at $723 million worldwide.</p><p>So, while Jolie may have missed out on what could’ve been a payday twice the amount she made on Maleficent, it’s believed she had a backend deal in place when she signed on for its sequel, which hit cinemas in 2019.</p><p>It’s rumored that Brad Pitt’s estranged wife took home anywhere from $50 million to $60 million for the second installment, which she also produced and starred in.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie’s Complicated Relationship With Her Brother, Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked by Collider in a 2014 interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what had made her want to star in </a><a href=#>Maleficent</a>, to begin with, the brunette gushed, “Well, I wanted to do something that my children could see. I wanted to have fun and explore different art and performance, in a way I hadn’t done.</p><p>“But most of all, I read Linda’s script and I was really moved by it. I actually got very emotional when I finished it. I thought it was one of the best scripts I’d read, in a long time, because of the issues it dealt with. I thought it was, in fact, an important story to tell.”</p><p>Jolie’s next major motion picture will be Marvel’s upcoming Eternals, which is rumored to earn her the biggest payday of her career, according to multiple reports close to the deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s still unclear how much Marvel offered the Los Angeles native, but considering how Robert Downey Jr pulled in $75 million from Avengers: Infinity War, it’s fair to assume that an actress as big as Jolie could potentially be earning similar numbers — especially if the movie fares well at the box office.</p><p>Jolie plays Thena, the 4000-year-old daughter of Cybele and Zura who was first generation Eternals, whose character plays a pivotal part in Marvel’s phase 4.</p><p>She’s also taken on the role of Karina in the upcoming drama, Every Note Played, alongside Christoph Waltz, who previously worked with the actress' estranged husband on 2009’s Inglorious B******ds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reacts To The Weeknd & Angelina Jolie Seen Together Again In LA Concert</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2021, reports claimed Jolie was ready to provide “proof of domestic abuse” in her ongoing divorce battle against Pitt, whom she parted ways from back in September 2016.</p><p>The pair have been embroiled in a bitter custody battle concerning their six children, with sources saying Jolie has not been fond of the idea of sharing custodial rights with her estranged husband following a supposed countless incidents of alleged abuse that occurred in their family household.</p><p>The usually very private star opened up in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">candid chat with British Vogue in February 2021 about the ordeal,</a> saying, “I don’t know.
