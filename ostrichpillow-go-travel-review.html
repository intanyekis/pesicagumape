After refusing to schlepp a travel pillow with me and then complaining about my neck for almost my whole life, I decided enough was enough and brought the Ostrichpillow with me on my flights to and from JFK to Aruba, Curaçao and then back.</p><p><strong>Transport and packing: </strong>I was originally against using a travel pillow because I didn’t want one more thing taking up space in my bag or in my hands — when I travel, they are already full with my passport and phone in one hand and a Starbucks in the other. While the pillow does not deflate or pack flat, it does come with a handy Velcro closure that I looped around my suitcase handle for a hands-free experience.</p><p><strong>Neck support: </strong>Obviously, the main purpose of a travel pillow is to support your neck when trying to sleep on a plane or in a car. I did find that I needed to adjust the pillow a few times to find my perfect position, as the Velcro can be finicky if you have a larger neck. However, once I found a comfy position, I was able to fall asleep perfectly, and woke with no discomfort in my neck or shoulders.</p><p><strong>Other uses: </strong>Because I also have a bad back and herniated discs (I know, too young for this!) I decided to undo the pillow and place it behind my back for some lumbar support. Due to the memory foam and the way the pillow wraps around the body, I actually loved this use even more than on my neck, and was able to recline while also supporting my lumbar.</p><p><strong>Washing and storage: </strong>After my return, I did a mountain load of laundry right away. All I had to do to wash my pillow was unzip the cover and toss it in the wash. I usually do all my laundry on cold to preserve the colors, so this worked just fine. To store, I kept the circular box that the pillow came in and was able to roll it up and put it back, good as new for my next trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/pillow-split.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Super soft and holds the weight of your neck well</li><li>Velcro closure for adjustable size and ability to attach to your luggage</li><li>Can be used for lumbar and back support as well</li><li>Washable</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Can not be packed flat</li><li>May not be suitable for those with large necks</li></ul><p class=has-text-align-center>For more content, check out the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post Shopping</a> section.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ5Gnwaqvy55mqKukp7aktM%2Bio6Wnp2K0sHnTq5ivnZxiv6bCyJ6uaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
