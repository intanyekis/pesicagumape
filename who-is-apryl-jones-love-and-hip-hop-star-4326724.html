Dr. Dre’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gorgeous dinner partner</a> is&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Apryl Jones</strong></a>, according to&nbsp;The Shade Room.

Now that fans are learning who this woman is, take some time to learn more about her with the five facts below!</p><h2><strong>Apryl Was On ‘Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood’</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Apryl was an original cast member on the series&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood</a>. She joined for its inaugural season in 2014. The reality TV personality really made a name for herself on the show, as the first season chronicled her first pregnancy with then-partner&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Omarion</strong></a>. Following the second season, Apryl left the show before returning to the reality TV series in season four, in which her relationship with rapper&nbsp;<strong>Lil Fizz</strong> was explored, as well. Apryl also appeared in the sixth season, but has not returned to the show since the reunion in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apryl-Jones-dr-dre-date-embed2.jpg><h2><strong>Apryl Has Two Children Children</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Apryl has two children, both of whom she shares with her ex, Omarion. She gave birth to the former couple’s son,&nbsp;<strong>Megaa</strong>, in August 2014, making her son six years old. Her daughter with Omarion,&nbsp;<strong>A’mei</strong>, was born roughly two years later in March 2016. Part of Apryl’s time on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood showed the former couple’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>custody battle</a> over their two children.</p><h2><strong>Apryl’s Past Relationships</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Apryl has been in the spotlight before due to the men she’s been linked to. Of course, her relationship with Omarion was front and center on&nbsp;Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. But her romance with Lil Fizz also caused quite a stir. Back in 2019, during season six of&nbsp;Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, Apryl flaunted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her romance with Lil Fizz</a>. What made the relationship all the more dramatic was that Lil Fizz was a close friend of Omarion before he and Apryl got together!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apryl-Jones-dr-dre-date-embed1.jpg><h2><strong>Apryl Is Into Fashion</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Along with some background in singing and songwriting, Apryl has become quite the business woman when it comes to fashion brands. She has her own label called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Life Is To Be Lived</a>, which features jumpsuits for women and kids. On the company’s main site, Apryl and her two youngsters are the main models for the campaigns!</p><h2><strong>Apryl Is Interested In Acting</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Along with her fashion brand, Apryl is seemingly interested in acting, as well. Between 2019 and 2020 alone, she has a few credits to her name. In 2019 she appeared in&nbsp;You Hittin’ Dat and I Got The Hook Up 2. In 2020, she had a starring role in the six-episode series&nbsp;Casting The Net and appeared in an episode of&nbsp;For The Love of Jason, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kusb7YpWSjp56awG64zq%2BcZpmemXqptc9mn6ioXajBor6MbWprbmdngXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
