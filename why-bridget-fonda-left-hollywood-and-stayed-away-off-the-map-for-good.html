So, it’s safe to say she began acting at a very young age. In fact, Fonda first became involved with the theatre when she was cast in a school production of Harvey.

According to reports, the actress lost control of her vehicle and ended up rolling her car over an embankment. The media claimed that Bridget had only survived the crash because she had been wearing her seatbelt.</p><p>But the result was that her thoracic vertebrae were fractured and she sustained some minor cuts and bruises. At the time of the accident, the star was set to guest star on the legal drama The Practice, but her part had to be recast and was ultimately played by Meet the Parents star Teri Polo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49007452.jpg><p>In March of that same year, the actress got engaged to film composer and frontman of the band Oingo Boingo, Danny Elfman.

This is where the former actress currently lives. Despite its closeness to Hollywood, Fonda has managed to completely cut ties with the acting industry and has even chosen to avoid social media altogether.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her efforts to stay out of the spotlight, Fonda was spotted by paparazzi at LAX airport earlier this year.
