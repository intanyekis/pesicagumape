A source had shared that the pair would use the event to "hard launch" their relationship after a few months of dating.</p><p><strong>Initially, people thought they would attend the Vanity Fair afterparty together. "I don't know if they will walk the Vanity Fair carpet together, but they will join up inside,"</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the source shared</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/zayn-malik-and-gigi-hadid-paparazzi.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Gigi Hadid Stays Silent On Zayn Malik’s Health After He Gives Update On Foot Injury">Gigi Hadid Stays Silent On Zayn Malik’s Health After He Gives Update On Foot Injury</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Viral footage shows Zayn's foot getting run over by a car as he was recently mobbed by fans in Paris.</p><p>Later on, the report changed to Bradley Cooper skipping the Vanity Fair party to spend a "quiet night in" with Gigi Hadid. <strong>It was made clear that his Oscars date would be his beloved mother, Gloria Campano, who had already met the model at the Golden Globes</strong>, but fans still held hope to get a glimpse of the new couple on the most important night of the year in the film industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it's now been clarified that they won't be seen together at the Oscars, or anywhere else, on March 10.</p><p>"<strong>Gigi is not attending the Oscars with Bradley and will be at home with her daughter</strong> [whom she has with Zayn Malik]," a source explained.</p><h2 id=despite-this-gigi-hadid-and-bradley-cooper-are-getting-serious>Despite This, Gigi Hadid And Bradley Cooper Are Getting Serious</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bradley-cooper-and-gigi-hadid-spotted-in-new-york.jpg><p>Back when the reports of them possibly walking the Vanity Fair red carpet together came out, sources shared that <strong>Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid's relationship is "definitely getting more serious, they are totally into each other."</strong></p><p>Gigi Hadid skipping the Oscars apparently doesn't change that. Gigi is just, logically, prioritizing taking care of her daughter over attending an evening with her boyfriend. There will be plenty of opportunities for the two of them to make their debut as a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Bradley and Gigi are both genuinely so happy," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider clarified</a>. "They're having a great time together, doing well as a couple, and co-parenting healthily on both sides."</strong></p><p>Putting the children first is something everyone involved has agreed on, and the new relationship hasn't caused any trouble with their exes.</p><p>"Everyone is getting along, and it’s a good dynamic among all the parties," a source said. <strong>"Zayn [Malik] is continuing to be involved as a dad. Irina [Shayk] is still doing her own thing and is happy in her own life. Everyone's being mature and focusing on their kids."</strong></p><p>Although we won't get the Cooper-Hadid hard launch this weekend, things seem to be getting serious between them, so it will probably happen soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqK2imLK0ecKlmKuhlq56qLXGomShmZSesW6%2FyqKnZqejmK6zv4yana2domK%2FprzOq6usZaeWuay1zaBkq52UYrCivs%2Beq2aaopaxrbHYZpqop6Cav3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
