They’re making stars and hearts!”</p><p>The talk show host then recalled trying to conceal her pimples with makeup while growing up. “You got a pimple? You had to get the cover-up. It’s never a shade found in nature. Cover-up used to look like Wite-Out,” she joked.</p><p>“Now, it is in fashion to wear your pimples proudly and cover them with bright stars and hearts, you name it.” Ripa concluded her tangent by saying, “I think a little modesty goes a long way with your pimples, because pimples are like nipples!”</p><p>Husband and cohost <strong>Mark Consuelos</strong> then changed the topic.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Ripa has weighed in on <a href=#>beauty trends</a> while hosting Live.

It just wants to be gray.”</p><p>After Consuelos, 53, asked his wife if she would be ready to so silver, Ripa replied, “I would do it.”</p><p>“It’s almost translucent in its quality, which I think is weird,” she explained. causing Consuelos to suggest that she remains a blonde for the time being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6CyrbjYZqmiqJFitrR5wKCYoqajqXq4scCroKefXaW2rrzLnmSpmaSYtaa%2FjKKlZqill7mqr44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
