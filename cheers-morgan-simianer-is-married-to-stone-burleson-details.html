We are so blessed!”</p><p>The Netflix personality donned a sparkly, long-sleeve mini dress with white cowboy boots for the occasion while Burleson, 27, opted for a white button-down shirt, blue jeans and a cowboy hat.</p><p>The twosome <a href=#>tied the knot</a> one day later on Sunday, May 28, in Hickory Creek, Texas. For the nuptials, <a href=#>the cheerleader</a> wore an elegant long-sleeve lace gown with pearl and beaded details.

There were even several teammates who didn’t know my story, so for them to learn about [my life] from watching the show was, I don’t know, a little weird at first,” Simianer told <a href=# rel=noopener>Shape</a> in January 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: “But I feel very, very thankful for the opportunity because there are so many people that have gone through similar situations or have struggled in different ways, and for me to be able to help people feel like <a href=#>they’re not alone</a> and that they’re not just going through this by themselves and making it relatable makes me feel like I’m helping other people — that’s the biggest thing for me.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see exclusive photos of Simianer and Burleson’s rehearsal dinner:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKmxxKuqZqWfp7SiuoysoKahkaOys3nIrGSmmaKntqawjK2mZqukpLumecGuqaWdo6S7brDErZiipKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
