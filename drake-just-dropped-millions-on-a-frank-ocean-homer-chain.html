The Champagne Papi was sitting courtside as the Raptors took on the Lakers in the rapper's native Toronto rocking the iced-out piece. Drizzy has been on something of a spending spree lately — <a href=#>which has included racks of cash for a few lucky fans.</a></p><p>More accurately, Drake was strutting around in a Sphere Legs High Jewelry Necklace. The chain features pavé links and .33 inch white diamonds on each of the four orbs. Additional diamonds grace&nbsp;the four branches on the head-turning floating pendant. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The item, which is currently sold out, weighs a total of 127.5 carats</a>.</p><p>The Certified Lover Boy paired the&nbsp;iced-out chain with a Sphere Legs High Jewelry Bracelet.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The bracelet features 18-carats of white gold and a weight of 14.23-carats of&nbsp;diamonds</a>. Both pieces belong to the Homer Label, a luxury venture launched by musician Frank Ocean in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans React Furiously As Drake Spends $2.2 Million On A Richard Mille Watch</a></span></p><p>Seeing Drizzy drop a few million shouldn't be a surprise. More than a decade after pursuing&nbsp;a career in music, he&nbsp;continues to chart well. The rapper&nbsp;has also had&nbsp;success in his non-musical business ventures. With a massive&nbsp;real-estate portfolio and the success of his OVO label, Drake has become one of hip-hops richest artists.</p><p>These days it looks like Drake isn’t afraid to spend his wealth either. In addition to dropping millions on luxury cars and a private jet —a Boeing 676 — the rapper also gambles millions betting on sporting events. Drizzy bet over $1 million on the Rams and Oddell Beckahm Jr in the Super Bowl and another $275,000 on UFC fighter Jorge Masvidal, <a href=#>though he did take a loss on the latter.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it’s difficult to write off the Young Papi as out of touch because he keeps generously handing our stacks&nbsp;of cash to a few&nbsp;lucky fans. While&nbsp;on vacation in Turks And Caicos, <a href=#>Drake teamed up with up-and-coming rapper Jack Harlow to bless a musician with 20 racks of cold hard cash</a>.</p><p>He did the same thing just weeks earlier <a href=#>when he handed&nbsp;a random fan $10,000.</a></p><p>For what it’s worth, Drake can afford to be generous. The rapper has built an impressive net worth and is reportedly worth north of $200 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Drake Celebrates The Success Of His New Album In Style By Renting Out An Arcade & Restaurant</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HNHH</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HighSnobriety</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8OrmKSdXZ%2FCtMCMnamoqKCasW65yKWjoqeeqHqwuoyaZJ%2BqkaO4brvCnpinZZikuqa%2BjJyfmqGeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
