She even used a fake English accent for the speaking parts of the song!&nbsp;The adult issues on the track have left many critics perplexed, thinking that she is way too young to be singing such an inappropriate song!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Her brother <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jaden Smith</strong></a>, 15, who makes a cameo in the video, tweeted the day after the video came out:</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Willow Is 12………I Think?</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Black Youth Project, a project aimed at examining youth culture in African American&nbsp;communities, also spoke out about the video on Facebook. They wrote:</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Willow Smith’s new single, “Summer Fling,” has raised some eyebrows due to its subject matter and accompanying video. A few op-eds have questioned the idea of a 12-year old having a “summer fling,” and whether or not the whole concept is just too mature.</p><h3>Willow Struggles To Make Hits After ‘Whip My Hair’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Willow may be young, but that hasn’t prevented her from landing a record deal! Willow is already signed with Jay-Z’s label, Roc Nation. It was during her time with Jay-Z that she released her debut single “Whip My Hair,” in 2010, which became an instant success. The youngest Smith has struggled since the hit, however, releasing a few tracks, none of which were able to reach the same level of fame. With all of the negative publicity surrounding the track, “Summer Fling” definitely doesn’t seem to to be the hit that she was looking for.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>What do you think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Is Willow’s new song “Summer Fling” inappropriate? Do you like the track?</p><h3>WATCH: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Melodic Chaotic – Summer Fling</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>— Lindsay Goldstein</strong></p><h3>More Willow Smith News:</h3><li>Willow Smith ‘After Earth’ Premiere Outfit: Is It Wonderful Or Weird?</li><li>Happy Birthday Willow Smith — Today, October 31, You’re 12 Years Old</li><li>Jaden & Willow Smith At TIFF: Growing Up So Fast</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH14e5BpZrChnKG5sMOMrKSirJhiwLa5zJ6pZp6cnruoedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
