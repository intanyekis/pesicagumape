In the following, we're going to take a closer look at one in particular that featured extra pressure for the cast. It aired right after the Super Bowl in 1996. The sitcom was given a full hour, and they took advantage, with several top tier guest stars appearing, including Jean-Claude Van Damme. Although Van Damme appearing on the show sounded appealing back then, but it was far from the reality behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'll take a closer look at the cameo, along with the reveal <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a></strong> made on how guest stars weren't always impressive, and were basically saved by the excellent writing from those behind the scenes. In addition, we'll reveal another problematic guest star who felt as though the cast were 'less than' during his cameo in the early seasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Sean Penn's Guest-Star Cameo Was Viewed As The Worst In The Show's History By The Friends Director</a></span></p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-revealed-guest-stars-on-friends-usually-weren-39-t-impressive>Matt LeBlanc Revealed Guest-Stars On Friends Usually Weren't Impressive</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-leblanc-candid.png><p>Friends had several A-list type guest-stars throughout its decade long run. Among the more memorable included <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong> and <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a>, both stars nailed their time on the show. However, that wasn't the case with every guest star, and this was confirmed by cast member Matt LeBlanc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking alongside Glamour, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBlanc had major praise for the writing team on Friends</a>. According to the actor, it was the writing that allowed the characters on the show to thrive, and that held true for the guest stars that weren't as impressive.</p><p>He reveals, "You can't be funny if you don't have good material."</p><p>"On Friends, we had some guest-stars who were less than spectacular, not the stunt-casting, but just regular guest-stars, and they weren't particularly great actors, but the material was so good that they scored. It's the writing."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Appearing On Friends Turned Into A Nightmare For Debra Jo Rupp</a></span></p><p>Guest stars can attest to this.

Titled 'The One After the Superbowl', <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the creators of Friends had big plans for the 1996 episode</a>, bringing in major guest stars, including Julia Roberts, Brooke Shields, Chris Isaak and Jean-Claude Van Damme among others.</p><p>Everyone who appeared on the episode received praise from those behind the scenes, except for one man, Jean-Claude Van Damme... Those behind the scenes knew it was going to be a tough task after the actor brushed off some advice that was given to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did he show up hours late, but he also refused to listen to what Kevin S.

As expected, Van Damme was not requested for a return, but he did ask someone backstage to fetch him some cereal before leaving... True story.</p><h2 id=jean-claude-van-damme-wasn-39-t-the-only-guest-star-that-rubbed-the-cast-the-wrong-way>Jean-Claude Van Damme Wasn't The Only Guest-Star That Rubbed The Cast The Wrong Way</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar50214817.jpg><p>In a candid discussion with Howard Stern, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston revealed other problematic guest stars on the show</a>. Although she didn't name the person in particular, Jen revealed that a certain star felt above the show early on during his cameo. It was later revealed to be Fisher Stevens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston recalls with Stern, “It was as if they were just too ‘above’ this, to be on a sitcom,” Aniston said. “And I remember when we were doing a network run-through, the network and the producers would just laugh. And this person would be like, ‘Listen to them, just laughing at their own jokes. So stupid, not even funny."</p><p>To his credit, Stevens did agree to what was said, and apologized to Aniston for it personally. The actor revealed that at that point in his career, he had never been on a sitcom, so he wasn't aware of the laid back norms behind the scenes. The fact that the show hadn't taken off yet could've also attributed to his behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ec%2Brpp2tk5q%2FtHnRnpiloaqasW62xJqlZpuclsKlsYyvmKdllJa6rrGMsJisZZFiuqq%2F05qinmWRm8GmvoyhnGallaK8s7XZnptmoJmoeq21zZ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
