Nearly three months ago, the Golden Globe-winning actress, 34, <a href=#>gave birth to son Julius Chick,</a> her first child with husband Austin Chick.</p><p>&nbsp;The Brazilian-born brunette looked absolutely stunning for her first red carpet since becoming a mom, wearing a purple, slightly sheer Monique Lhuillier that showed off her legs beneath and toned arms. Baccarin joked with E! News' <a href=#><strong>Giuliana Rancic</strong></a> during the pre-show that she "blew up!" during the pregnancy. (Indeed, Baccarin attended awards shows — flaunting a sizable bump beautifully — into the late stages of her third trimester.)</p><p>Little Julius, she said, is "doing great, he's smiling, which you really need," Baccarin said. "We're not getting a lot of sleep around the house but that's okay. He's super cute!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>&nbsp;One complaint? Well-meaning folks were very quick to ask when Baccarin might get pregnant again. "The first to ask was a nurse at the hospital," she said. "I thought, I'm going to kill you right now! You need to stop! I can't even think about it."</p><p>The SAGs, she added, were a perfect, relatively casual event to return to the cameras. "It feels like at this show everyone is in the mood to party," she aid. "It's our community, and I feel like there's a little less pressure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamp6Kau6J5wZqanJminrtuu8Vmn6illaGur7CMnZybraSoerG70q1km5mSrnqju8OyZJqsXaiuqL%2BMa2dqbF2nsqV5wpqpqZ2kYr2qr9OuqZ5lYmV%2BdX2XamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
