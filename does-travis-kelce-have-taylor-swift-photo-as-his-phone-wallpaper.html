Eagle-eyed fans quickly noticed that the home screen was unlocked, so that Kelce’s smartphone apps were visible.</p><p class=p1>Swifties immediately zoomed in on the photo, trying to identify what was in the background. While Kelce held his hand over the majority of the screen, fans <a href=#>speculated that he was covering up</a> a picture of Swift, 33.</p><p class=p1>“Travis has got Taylor as his lock screen, I’d recognize those bangs anywhere LFG,” one fan wrote in a<a href=# rel=noopener> since-deleted X (formerly Twitter) </a>post, claiming that the blue in the pic corresponded to the dress that Swift <a href=#>wore at her <i>Eras Tour </i>premiere</a>. (Swift wore a <a href=#>turquoise Oscar de la Renta gown</a> to the red carpet event in Los Angeles earlier this month.)</p><p class=p1>Neither Kelce nor Swift have confirmed what he keeps as his background, though the NFL star clearly had Swift on his mind throughout the Friday game.</p><p class=p1>“We love Taylor,” <strong>Claire Couv Smith</strong>, the wife of Texas Rangers athlete<strong> Josh Smith</strong>, quipped via her Instagram Story on Friday as Kelce walked past her following <a href=#>the Rangers’ victory</a> over the Arizona Diamondbacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/does-travis-kelce-have-taylor-swift-photo-as-his-phone-wallpaper-inline.jpg><p class=p1>Kelce then turned his head and replied, “Thank you. Congrats on the win!”</p><p class=p1>After the game, Kelce hit up a local Arlington, Texas, bar and joined their post-victory celebration. He was even spotted belting out Swift’s “Love Story” with fans.</p><p class=p1>Kelce first revealed in July that he was interested in getting to know Swift, noting that he planned to <a href=#>gift her a homemade friendship bracelet</a> with his phone number when he went to see her<a href=#> <i>Eras Tour </i>show</a> in Kansas City. While Kelce felt “butthurt” that Swift did not accept the trinket, they eventually connected and<a href=#> went on a series of dates</a>.</p><p class=p1>Kelce and Swift <a href=#>took their romance to the next level</a> when<a href=#> she came to see him “rock the stage”</a> at KC’s Arrowhead Stadium during the Chiefs’ game against the Chicago Bears in September. The Grammy winner was dressed head-to-toe in his team’s merch and <a href=#>bonded with Travis’ mother,<strong> Donna Kelce</strong>,</a> in a private suite.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Swift has since <a href=#>attended three more of Travis’ football games</a> throughout the month of October, even wearing <a href=#>a bracelet with his 87 jersey number</a> at the October 22 home game against the Los Angeles Chargers.</p><p class=p1>“They’re really happy.
