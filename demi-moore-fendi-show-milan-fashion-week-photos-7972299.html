She accessorized with wire-rimmed glasses, a gold cuff bracelet and long, dainty, drop earrings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the show, she also wore light green gloves while clapping and blowing kisses at the Wednesday event, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>footage</a> shared by Vogue on Instagram shows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle actress was part of a star-studded lineup in the front row of the Fendi show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She was joined by models <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Moss</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Naomi Campbell</a>, Linda Evangelista and Amber Valletta as well as fellow actresses <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Christina Ricci</a>, Gwendoline Christie, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Naomi Watts</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Cara Delevingne</a> and Suki Waterhouse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moore smiled, posed for photos and chatted with Christie, 44, at the show, per photos obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>. Afterward, Moore posed for a photo behind-the-scenes with Valletta, Ricci, Christie and Fendi’s artistic director, Kim Jones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, Moore chatted with PEOPLE about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her relationship with fashion</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I do appreciate fashion, and I have a relationship with designers who I respect and admire,” she said at the time. “But I still feel like a little kid who gets to dress up and who I am at heart is a grubby 12-year-old boy who really likes to just be comfortable and wear baggy clothes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The star also shared that her tried-and-true pandemic uniform was a pair of overalls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I'm in Idaho, it's generally overalls all day, every day," Moore told PEOPLE. "That's as much me as wearing a super-gorgeous red carpet gown or a chic designer outfit front row at Fashion Week."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Demi Moore attends Fendi's Spring Summer 2024 show at Milan Fashion Week.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Daniele Venturelli/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moore also said that her daughters — Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29 — are her "biggest teachers," and she looks to them for style tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is a mutual exchange of style inspiration," she said of her girls. "When they're being themselves, that's the most inspiring for me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “I saw my youngest daughter wearing this vintage Japanese silk robe out, and I looked at it and said, ‘Is that from my storage?’ And she said, ‘Yes, I liberated it.’ At the end it's going to all go to them anyway, so why not let them dip in?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the same interview, the G.I. Jane star also expressed a desire to change the “idea that women become less desirable as we get older" and said that embracing her age has been "liberating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked what she looks forward to most about her 60th birthday, she said: "Not being defined by a number and instead being defined by my experience.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You hit 59 and you're already thinking, 'Well, I'm going to be 60.' It feels very liberating,” Moore continued. “When I think of my grandmother at 60, she in a way seemed to be already resigned to being old. But I feel, in so many ways, more alive and present than ever.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Sauqp5zKimq51dm7KvsMhmqqGnp2K6qrjAp2SfmaOdtrC6jLCcnqNdpbWwwM6sZHBxZ2d%2FeoU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
