I love my body the way it is. But I will say that I am trying to lose weight for health reasons,” Jazz, 21, explains to a group of people in Us Weekly‘s exclusive clip of the Tuesday, December 7, episode of the TLC series. “I have to feel good, too, and I don’t feel good with some of the foods that I have been eating. I really am working on this weight loss so I can be healthier and more me.”</p><p>The reality star also discusses whether she was happy with the results of <a href=#>her 2018 gender confirmation surgery.</a></p><p>“It definitely lives up to everything I fantasized for so many years of my life. I asked my mom when the good fairy is going to wave her magic wand and turn my penis into a vagina. It was my dream to undergo this surgery even from a young age,” the YouTube personality explains. “Even though I did experience a huge complication, I feel like I finally have the body I always wanted and I have that mind-body alignment that just wasn’t there before. I feel like I’m complete.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jazz-Jennings-Addresses-Her-Weight-Loss-Journey-in-I-Am-Jazz-Season-7-Sneak-Peek.jpg><p>Since her reality series began in 2015, Jazz has been <a href=#>candid about the various ups and downs</a> she’s experienced in her life. Ahead of the November debut of season 7, the Florida native took to social media <a href=#>to discuss her complicated relationship with food.</a></p><p>“As many of you have noticed, over the past few years, I have gained a substantial amount of weight. I suffer from binge-eating disorder, a disease in which I’m not only addicted to food, but I eat it in large quantities,” Jazz wrote in June alongside side-by-side photos of herself. “My binging, along with an increased appetite I experience from some of the meds I’m on, has caused me to gain almost 100 pounds in a little less than 2 years.”</p><p>At the time, Jazz explained that she <a href=#>chose to share her journey publicly because she wanted to hold herself “accountable”</a> when it came to addressing her weight gain.</p><p>“I’m ready to change my ways; I’ve been saying I’m ready to turn over a new leaf, but I’m running out of trees now,” she continued. “I’m ready to take the initiative and create positive changes when it comes to my health and body.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jazz-Jennings-Addresses-Her-Weight-Loss-Journey-in-I-Am-Jazz-Season-7-Sneak-Peek-2.jpg><p>The TLC personality admitted that although she has plenty of support in her life, she is the only one who can commit “toward bettering myself,” adding, “I know I have the power in me to lose the weight, and I intend on sharing my progress with all of you. Love you all, and thanks for understanding the battle I’m fighting to win.”</p><p>Jazz isn’t the only one in her family <a href=#>who has benefited from expressing themselves on the series</a>. In next week’s episode, her 23-year-old brother opens up about dealing with people making assumptions about his sexuality.</p><p>“It doesn’t really bother me when someone is like, ‘Hey, are you gay?’ I’ve gotten it so many times that it has just gotten repetitive. But, like, back in the day I let it bring me down and make me question myself,” he says at the meeting with his sister. “But then when I looked at myself in the mirror, I am just like, ‘I know what my attraction is to.’ I found that confidence and I’ve shared that in videos and now here today with all you guys.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He adds: “I identify as cisgender and heterosexual. But not a day goes by that people do not question my sexuality and ask me if I am gay or anything like that. To all the cisgender, heterosexual allies out there, anyone who questions your sexuality shouldn’t make you question yourself.”</p><p>I Am Jazz airs on TLC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKBmmZ1it6LG2WaapaGgYreixtlmoZ6mnp67qL%2BMmpudqpWowKa%2FjKGcq2WnmraotNNmo6iro2K3sMHRp5yyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
