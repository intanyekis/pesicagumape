"The area that the show takes place in, the basement, the kitchen, Debra Jo [Rupp], Kurtwood Smith — that's all the same. They updated it to make it look like ’90s Wisconsin, which is more like ’80s America, which is wonderful."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Black Swan Was Physically Draining For Mila Kunis To Shoot, But Jupiter Ascending Was Even Worse</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Kunis' character Jackie is revealed to be married to Kelso</a>, with whom they share a son.

Kunis revealed on the podcast that it wasn't love at first sight.</p><p>"We've been together 10 years and I still think this is crazy," she said. "The crazy part is anyone that says, ‘Oh, I knew back then, the two of them the way they were.’ They are liars. Nobody knew.

If I did by one of the cast members another cast member would stand up for it. The reason I don’t do drugs was because nobody on the set did. And I looked up to them at 14.
