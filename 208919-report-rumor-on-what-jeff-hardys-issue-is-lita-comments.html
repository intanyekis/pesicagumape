The hosts kept asking her about her personal life but she was having none of it. When they asked her if she was still dating Edge, she said that even if she was, she wouldn’t tell us because she learned her lesson last time. She sounded very uncomfortable and did not want to talk about wrestling at all. When asked about Jeff Hardy’s suspension, Lita said that she hadn’t heard about it yet but “it sucks”. She refused to answer whether Jeff uses drugs. Afterwards, the hosts ragged on her and said she was a bad interview guest.</p><p>From what I understand, Jeff Hardy is now in rehab. The word we are getting is that Hardy was denying he had a problem and was rejecting the idea of going to rehab. Apparently Hardy has been having a drinking problem. This is just what I (Ryan Clark) have heard and I’ll keep you posted as I get more. I was hesitant to post this so take it for what it’s worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfo9xcGpxXaeysbvRrWSrrZ2kv267zWauoZmkYremssVmn5qqlK7AbrXSrKyeZZmoeq2105pknKedorKvwNI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
