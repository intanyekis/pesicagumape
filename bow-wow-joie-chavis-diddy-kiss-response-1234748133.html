We handled it the way we was supposed to handle it. There’s a conduct and code men go by and everyone knows certain things are off limits. Wives and baby mamas is just some s**t that, you know, you steer clear from.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chavis took to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> in January 2022 to <a href=#>address allegations of a scandal</a> considering Diddy was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234667852>reportedly dating</a> Yung Miami at the time of the kiss. “Since y’all so damn nosy, here it is! Me and him are friends and have been!,” wrote the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234740187>mother of two</a>. “I was working on an unreleased project for him and thats why I was in Italy! In the midst of me being there we kissed, thats it. Didn’t go further than that! I had my own damn room and he has always been respectful to me as a friend. The kiss shouldn’t have happened, but it did, and theres nothing I can do about it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Just last week, Bow praised Diddy for giving him some of the best advice during a period where he was the victim of trolling. The<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234695659> Fast & Furious</a> alum explained on the My Expert Opinion podcast, “That n***a told me straight up: ‘Come here, don’t be doing no clown s**t. The f**k wrong with you? N***a, you know we don’t associate with no clown s**t. You Bow, n***a.&nbsp;You better understand your brand and get out here and go to work. C’mon, man. You doing it to yourself. Go to work. Be quiet, lay low and go to work and watch what’s gonna happen.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Bow discuss the kiss, his beef with <a href=# id=auto-tag_jermaine-dupri data-tag=jermaine-dupri>Jermaine Dupri</a>, and more with Baller Alert below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8uHnWqK5mop%2Besm6vx5qtoqtdmbalsNhmoqKro2K%2Fpr%2FPqKWsnV1mf3SAlm1vamtjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
