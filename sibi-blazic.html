All for good reason of course. When Bale was shooting the Dark Knight Rises in 2012, Blazic was a stunt driver and was chasing Bale all around the city. As Bale later revealed, Blazic was in one of the cop cars and is quite proficient in doing 180s and other jaw-dropping stunts. While Blazic certainly seems to be the do it all kind of woman, she has a soft side to her. Over the years, Bale has been open about how Blazic has helped to shape him into the man he has become. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Sibi Blazic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Srbislava Blazic was born on the 14th of April 1970, in Chicago, Illinois. The only child of Slobodan Blazic and Nadezhda Topalski, Blazic’s parents are originally from Serbia and had Blazic after their move to the US. To make the transitioning process easier for Blazic, her parents assigned her an English name, Sandra. Born and raised in Chicago, not much is known about Blazic’s early life. She graduated from a local high school in Chicago in 1988 and went off to the University of Southern California. Blazic also made the move to advance her career as a model, an interest that she had developed during her senior year of high school. She later graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Business.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sibi-Blazic-and-husband-Christian-Bale.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Blazic worked as a model for most of her early years but an increasing interest in movies drew her toward Hollywood. She took an interesting route to Hollywood and first worked as a make-up artist and later as a personal assistant. In 1977, Blazic started working as an assistant to producer Jordan Kerner and was involved in the production of George of the Jungle and Red Corner (1997).</p><p>Blazic continued her work over the years but could never find the success she wanted. In 1999, Blazic started working as a personal assistant to Winona Ryder and worked with Ryder on a few movies including Girl Interrupted, Autumn in New York, and Lost Souls. Blazic also participated in a few other movies like The Machinist (2004), Vice (2018), and Ford v Ferrari (2019). She was a part of the stunt crew for The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Ford V Ferrari (2019). Her husband, Christina Bale who starred in the Dark Knight, was quite <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>appreciative</a> and amazed at his wife’s work in The Dark Knight Rises.&nbsp;</p><p>“My wife was a stunt driver — she was chasing me through the city in Batman. She was driving one of the cop cars. She can do 180s and stunts and all that. She terrifies me. My wife terrifies me.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth:</h2><p>Sibi Blazic has an estimated net worth of USD 4 Million which she accumulated through her professional endeavors in Hollywood. If we look at her husband’s fortune it makes her look ridiculous. Christian Bale has an astonishing net worth of $120 Million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life:</h2><p>Sibi Blazic has been happily married to Christian Bale and the pair have been together for two decades. Before meeting Blazic, Bale would often state how he would never get married, and given the history of divorce in his family, things were far from ideal for Bale. However, things changed after he met Blazic. At the time, she was working as a personal assistant to Winona Ryder. The pair began dating soon after and eloped to Vegas to tie the knot. The wedding ceremony was held on the 29th of January 2000, at the time, Bale was 26 years old and Blazic was 30. The pair have a daughter, Emmeline Bale, who was born in 2005, and a son, Joseph Bale, in August 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>For all his accomplishments, Bale has always credited his wife for putting in the hard work.&nbsp;</p><p>“I get choked up about that stuff… [My wife] had to be married to so many different characters over our marriage. I know that it truly would be impossible to do it without her. She’s such a good, strong woman.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick bio of her children:</h2><p>Sibi and Christian welcomed their eldest child Emmeline Bale on March 27, 2005, in a hospital in Brentwood, California. As responsible parents, the pair have always tried to keep her away from the clutches of the Paparazzi. Neither Christian nor Sibi discusses their private life in front of the media. However, Bale cannot contain his excitement when he shares the cute moments of his children. The Terminator Salvation actor shared an experience involving Emmeline on the sets. When four years old, Emmeline loved dressing up in various costumes and fitting make-up while visiting her father on stage. She would dress up as Darth Vader or Yoda, to name a few characters. She also has a pet dog named Jeanee.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sibi-Blazic-Christian-Bale-Children.jpg><p>Emmeline has followed in her parent’s footsteps, showing an interest in modeling. She hit the runway in a parade held by the prestigious company; Dolce and Gabbana when she was only 17. Along with her, other celebrity children too walked the ramp. Deva Cassel, daughter of Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel, and Leni Klum, daughter of the supermodel Heidi Klum accompanied her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Joseph Bale, the adorable little Bale was born in August 2014, but unfortunately, little to no information about the youngest Bale child is known.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=7.5><tr readability=2><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Full Name:</th><td>Srboslava (Srbislava)&nbsp;Blazic</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Nick Name:</strong></td><td>Sibi &nbsp;Blazic</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Birth Date:</th><td>April 14,&nbsp;1970</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Horoscope:</th><td>Aries</td></tr><tr readability=4><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Birth Place:</th><td>Chicago, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Net Worth:</th><td>$4 million (estimated)</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Height / How tall :</th><td>5 feet 11 inches (1.80m)</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Ethnicity:</th><td>Serbian</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Nationality:</th><td>American, Serbian</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Gender:</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Sexuality:</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Lesbian:</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Marital Status:</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Husband:</strong></td><td>Christian Bale (m.2002)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Children:</strong></td><td>Emmeline Bale (born. 2005), Joseph Bale (born. 2014)</td></tr><tr readability=4><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Profession:</th><td>Former Model, Stunt Driver, Actress</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Father’s Name:</th><td>Slobodan Blazic</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Mother’s Name:</th><td>Nadezda Topalski</td></tr><tr readability=2><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Education:</th><td>University of Southern California</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Hair Color:</th><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Eye Color:</th><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Social Media:</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Article originally published on<br>February 14, 2021, at 2:09 am Universal time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiqopqZYq%2Btrdmimmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
