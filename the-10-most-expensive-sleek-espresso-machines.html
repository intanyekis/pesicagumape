Espresso actually means "quick coffee" or "coffee served quickly", thus the small cups that can be swallowed in three-four gulps. Italy is known for having amazing cafes as well as espresso machines.</p><p>The trend toward fancier espresso drinks came along later and, in the U.S., was made popular by Starbuck's, Pete's Coffee and similar coffee chains. Ironically, these chains have made their way into other countries, although the European countries seem to still prefer their most traditional cafes. It's now been a generation of Starbuck's customers, so it's likely the espresso and it's fancy counterparts are here to stay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Espresso (often incorrectly called expresso) is actually not the type of bean, but is the specific roast of the bean and the process in which it is made.&nbsp;Most coffee beans can be roasted as espresso beans and roasting preferences are generally in light, medium or heavy, with most cafes using the medium. The roasted beans are ground fine and packed into the espresso basket and a specific pressure (135 psi) to push the steaming hot water (200 degrees) through the grounds. The whole process takes about 30 seconds and produces about 1-2 oz. of liquid. Italians often add a sugar cube, but you'll rarely see milk or cream being added.</p><p>Espresso machines come in all different sizes, from individual to multiple shower heads for brewing many shots at the same time. Some of today's most popular espresso specialty drinks are: cappuccinos, lattes and mochaccinos, which all start with shots of espresso. These machines are used in private homes as well as coffee houses. We've put together a list of the most expensive machines available, for you espresso aficionados out there. Some are fully automatic, while others are manual; both are said to produce outstanding java. The sign of a good cup of espresso is the presence of crema, the foam on your espresso.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Welcome to the world of espresso machines that many claim would love to own.
