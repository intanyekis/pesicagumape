Daniel also shared photos of him getting close to Ariana in his Instagram story, including one where they were “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>waiting for <strong>Frank </strong>[<strong>Ocean</strong>]</a>” to play.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Before these photos and videos of her steamy PDA with her new man, Ariana spent time with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> partying it up alongside her friend. She sported a deconstructed top with long sleeves and cutouts. Her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>festival attire</a> included a pair of white Converse sneakers. All she needed to complete the outfit was a bit of arm candy, which she got in the form of her ripped, physically fit man. So, who is Daniel Wai? Let’s find out.</p><h2><strong>Daniel Wai Is A Physical Trainer…</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I have been a trainer for the past decade, and it has been one of the most fulfilling and humbling experiences,” writes Daniel on his website. “However, my interest in physical health and conditioning has been with me since I was 13 years old. As a typical teenager, I was insecure with my size and strength and decided to incorporate exercise and physical fitness into my life, and it has been a large part of my life ever since.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Daniel writes that he’s “passed my NASM Corrective Exercise Specialist Certification and am now studying for my National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists (CSCS) certification. Training to me, is not just a profession but a labor of love and dedication. I am passionate about the work I do, and to me, it is truly the most fulfilling and satisfying career.”</p><h2><strong>…Who Could Probably Fix Your Wifi, Set Up Your iPhone, and Balance Your Budget</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>There is a brain that goes with all that muscle. “During college, I had majored in Computer Science and a secondary degree in Business and minor in math,” writes Daniel in his bio. ” After graduating college, I went on to do consulting work for many clients, including some Fortune 500 companies. After many years of working in this industry, which consisted of many hours on client sites around the country, nights spent in hotels, and hours spent for traveling, I made an executive decision for myself and decided to do consulting work out of my home city, the great city of New York.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, his passion for physical perfection and his part-time job at “one of the top health clubs in Manhattan” brought him more joy. So he quit his job and dedicated himself to being a trainer and fitness coach.</p><h2>Daniel Hails From NYC.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Daniel’s Instagram is full of shots of him working out next to famous New York City landmarks, including <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Vessel at Hudson Yards</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Brooklyn Bridge</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Times Square</a>.</p><h2>He Graduated From Virginia Tech.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>A <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn account</a> attributed to Daniel Wai says she graduated from Virginia Tech in 2005 with a B.A in Business Information Technology, and a B.S. in Computer Science. In December 2021, he posted a video of him seeing his “favorite sports team” – the Virginia Tech Hokie – play at his “favorite ballpark.” That month, the Hokies played the Maryland Terrapin in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New Era Pinstripe Bowl</a>.</p><h2>He Is Also Into Anime, Comic Books & Video Games.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>In an Oct. 11 Instagram video, Daniel shares his experiences attending New York Comic-Con. The cover image for the video shows some of his haul – including the Secret Wars comic where Spider-Man gets his black suit for the first time – and the video shows some of the cosplayers he saw. “The best is at the end,” he wrote, indicating “the father and his two daughters dressing up” as Kratos, Atreus, and Freya from God Of War.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KxorrInqNmr5GeenZ8lm9qanBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
